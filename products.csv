look at therapeutic <strong>Hormone Replacement Therapy</strong> (HRT) or performance enhancement and you’ll find hundreds of varying answers to the same question(s) and it often becomes difficult to really discover the truth. For reasons that are more confusing than the confusion that exists within hormones themselves for reasons that make very little sense, often hormones are discussed on the basis of emotion while rational and logical thinking give way to intrinsic hysteria. In the world of anabolic androgenic steroids this phenomena is easy to see but it stretches far beyond steroids into most every hormone that can be used in any sense of performance enhancement. Human Growth Hormone is a prime example of this confusion and while it may take first prize, without question <strong>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin</strong> (hCG) is in the running neck and neck. There are truly many uses for the hCG hormone and we will hopefully here alleviate some of your confusion. hCG can be a very useful tool in both HRT and performance enhancement but as is with all things in life there is a right way and a wrong way to use it. In many ways to understand the benefits we only need to look at the hormone itself, what it is and from there we can easily explain the benefits within as well as guide you through proper use.</p><h3>hCG:</h3><p>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is a glycoprotein hormone produced in the embryo of pregnant women. No, <em>hCG</em> is not an anabolic steroid as it is often labeled, it is a glycoprotein belonging to the class of hormones known as peptides, the same class of hormones from which IGF-1 and HGH belong to. Comprised of 237 amino acids this naturally occurring peptide exhibits the action of the pituitary released Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and essential gonadotropin itself; as you may be able to see, to understand hCG fully we must understand gonadotropins. A gonadotropin is a hormone that stimulates just that, the gonads and in regards to LH this is a gonadotropin that stimulates hormonal production, notably testosterone, for without no testosterone is produced. In men this stimulation causes the testicles to function and in women it does the same for the ovaries and it is for this reason <strong>hCG</strong> is often given to women who suffer from disorders in order to stimulate ovarian action. One might ask how this pertains to anabolic steroids for it is fairly easy to see how a suffering woman might benefit due to ovarian disorder. When we supplement with anabolic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed, often greatly with the particular steroid(s) and dosing playing a vital role. Through hCG use we have a provided means of replicating pituitary stimulation thereby causing LH release, in-turn leading to once again natural testosterone production. This is not only beneficial to the anabolic steroid user, particularly those of a performance enhancing nature but it can be highly beneficial to the low testosterone patient as well.</p><h3>The Benefits of hCG:</h3><p>For the <strong>anabolic steroid</strong> user there is really only one major benefit to hCG use and that is stimulating natural testosterone production. When we supplement with anabolic steroids our <strong>naturaltestosterone levels</strong> are suppressed; it is for this very reason most performance enhancers will supplement with the testosterone hormone with most any stack, as testosterone is a vital hormone to proper bodily function and not to mention a hormone that packs a powerful anabolic punch. When the anabolic steroid user supplements with hCG he has two options, supplementation while on cycle and supplementation after cycle as part of a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan. Both have their benefits but the mode of action in-which hCG performs is the same in either case. While both instances of use can be beneficial and hCG performs by the same way of action one method of use is far more beneficial than the other and it is undoubtedly post cycle use. How it works is very simple; the injected hCG will send a signal to the testicles mimicking LH and as LH stimulates natural testosterone production the production will begin once again. Understand, while this production can be beneficial it will not be to the fullest extent possible while on cycle but many athletes swear by its use on cycle. The claim is simple; by maintaining some natural testosterone production while on cycle it makes the transition to off-cycle all the more efficient and this is important for a host of reasons but they all revolve around testosterone. When we come off cycle our natural testosterone levels are understandably suppressed and often dramatically. As there are no longer any exogenous hormones being introduced into our body at thecycles end something must be done to restart natural production. Yes, it will begin again on its own but this can take a very long time and if one has cycled for an extended period of time there is a strong risk of production never reaching its full potential if no action is taken. If we come off cycle and our testosterone levels remain low a host of problematic occurrences can rear their nasty heads; you can wave goodbye to your hard earned muscle tissue and say hello to body fat gain. You will further more than likely suffer from libido loss and even erectile dysfunction and a host of other low testosterone related issues ranging from lethargy and depression to a weakened immune system and simply physically and mentally feeling like a pile of garbage. This is where post cycle <strong>hCG</strong> can really shine, as it will stimulate testosterone production greatly and get you well on your way to a full and efficient recovery.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of hCG:</h3><p>As is the case with all hormones there is a potential for negative side-effects with Human Chorionic Gonadotropin use but fortunately such side-effects are not as large of a concern as you might think for this is a very well-tolerated hormonal treatment in most healthy adult men. Nevertheless side-effects do have some probability and will be very similar to many of the aromatizing anabolic steroids you may already be accustomed to using. Adverse side-effects such as <strong>Gynecomastia and water retention are the most common of the possible effects</strong> but they are also in most cases largely dose dependent, meaning, high-end doses carry with them a much greater probability. Another side-effect worthy of mentioning may sound like a bit of a paradox; hCG can greatly suppress natural testosterone production, the very production you are trying to stimulate. The hypothalamus carries with it the responsibility of releasing LH and with <strong>hCG</strong> use we are entering in an exogenous form, thereby signaling to the hypothalamus no LH release is needed. For this reason it is imperative dosing and duration of the hormone be kept in a responsible range and if used post cycle it is further imperative SERM’s such as Nolvadex and Clomid be part of the equation, ending with one or the other once hCG use is complete. Failure to abide by these rules could lead to permanent low testosterone.</p><h3>Truly the Best form of Use:</h3><p>We have already stated, PCT use of hCG is by far the most beneficial but until the end of time there will be those who strongly disagree. Let’s look at the facts; when on cycle your natural testosterone is suppressed but suppression in-terms of maintaining testosterone in your system should be no concern if you are supplementing with exogenous testosterone. Further, while hCG use will stimulate some natural production while on cycle it will not do so to the fullest extent and nowhere nearly as great as commonly believed; however, your body will become accustomed to a mimicked LH and as we discussed above this can be a damaging occurrence if <strong>hCG</strong> is used for too long. Many men supplement with hCG their entire cycle and many times it’s out of ego for hCG can keep your testicles from shrinking to a degree but in the long run they’re only hurting themselves when they follow such protocol. Make no mistake, use of this peptide should never extend past 4 weeks and there should be at <strong>least 4-5 weeks</strong> of discontinued use before any use is considered again.</p><h3>hCG Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For Human Chorionic Gonadotropin use while on a cycle of anabolic steroids there is no reason to begin use until at least 4 weeks have passed into the cycle. Once this point is reached <strong>300iu-500iu</strong>can be applied every 5th day for approximately 4 weeks of use. Once the 4th week is completed a 4 week off period will need to take place and then you can repeat if desired and so on and so on. However, from what we’ve discussed above you may have already gathered we do not recommend this method. If hCG is to be used during cycle, while many will do so as we just described we find that using the same dosing protocol the final weeks of the cycle and those weeks only to be the most efficient while further continuing use into ones PCT plan. For post cycle hCG use, while the final above on cycle method would also partially encompass PCT the following is generally our favorite. Once the cycle ends you will start hCG but the time frame will depend on the anabolic steroids that the cycle ended with. For example, if the cycle ended with any long ester gear we will wait approximately 10-14 days before hCG therapy begins; if it ends will all short ester based steroids your <strong>hCG therapy will begin approximately 3-4 days</strong> after your final anabolic steroid administration. In either case <strong>1,000iu will be administered every day for 10 straight days followed by a good 3-4 week</strong> run of Nolvadex or Clomid therapy; in many cases it may be a good idea to use a little Nolvadex while using hCG for this purpose at a low 10mg-20mg dose, then upping the dose to a full 40mg per day when the hCG is discontinued. It is important to note, mild cycles and cycles of short duration will not require hCG use; for example, an <strong>8-12 week cycle of 500mg of testosterone per week</strong> will probably not require such therapy but when we reach the 12 week mark and beyond or when doses reach high performance levels post cycle hCG is strongly recommended. By performing such therapy we will greatly enhance our recovery, lead ourselves to a faster recovery, hold onto more of our gains and most importantly of all maintain a better state of overall health.</p>","<div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) 5000 IU, Pregnyl 1 amp + 1 solvent</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 01:31:34",1,open,74,,,no,no,,75,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hcg-human-chorionic-gonadotropin-2.jpg ! alt :  ! title : hcg-human-chorionic-gonadotropin (2) ! desc :  ! caption :  | https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hcg-human-chorionic-gonadotropin-3.jpg ! alt :  ! title : hcg-human-chorionic-gonadotropin (3) ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/pregnyl-msd-5000-1-amp-1-solvent/,50,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"ANTIESTROGENS and PCT|ORIGINAL PHARMACY PRODUCTS","buy hcg|buy pregnyl",

Finajet contained trenbolone acetate, which was a very fast acting form of this drug. Parabolan contains a much different ester, trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate. This ester extends the activity of the drug for more than two weeks, a more suitable design for human use. Parabolan is packaged only in ampules of 1.5 ml, one ampule per a box. Each ampule contains 76 mg of trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate, equivalent to 50 mg of trenbolone base (French drugs commonly make this calculation). Trenbolone is a very potent androgen with strong anabolic activity. It is well suited for the rapid buildup of strength and muscle mass, usually providing the user exceptional results in a relatively short time period. The anabolic effect of this drug is often compared to popular bulking agents such as testosterone or Dianabol, with one very important difference. Trenbolone does not convert to estrogen. This is indeed a very unique compound since mass drugs, almost as a rule, will aromatize (or cause other estrogen related troubles) heavily. When we think of taking milder (regarding estrogen) steroids we usually expect much weaker muscle growth, but not so with Parabolan. Here we do not have to worry about estrogen related side effects, yet still have an extremely potent mass/strength drug. There is no noticeable water retention, so the mass gained during a cycle of Parabolan will be very hard and defined (providing fat levels are low enough). Gynecomastia is also not much of a concern, so there shouldn't be any need to addition an antiestrogen if trenbolone is the only steroid administered. The high androgen level resulting from this steroid, in the absence is excess estrogen, can also accelerate the burning of body fat. The result should be a much tighter physique, hopefully without the need for extreme dieting. Parabolan can therefore help bring about an incredibly hard, ripped physique and is an ideal product for competitive bodybuilders. This is of course no secret, and when available on the market, Parabolan was the most sought after contest preparation drug. Now this it is no longer produced, acceptable substitutes for this purpose include of course veterinary trenbolone acetate preparations, as well as Halotestin, Proviron and Masteron (also recently discontinued). Trenbolone is notably more potent than testosterone, and has an effect that is as much as three times as strong on a milligram for milligram basis. Likewise we can expect to see some level of androgenic side effects with use of this compound. Oily skin, aggressive behavior, acne and hair loss are therefore not uncommon during a cycle with this steroid. The androgenic nature of this drug of course makes it a very risky item for women to use, the chance for virilization symptoms extremely high with such a potent androgen. And since the hexahydrobenzylcarbonate ester will extend the activity of this drug for weeks, blood levels can be very difficult to control. Since many of the masculinizing side effects associated with steroid use can be permanent, women considering the use of this compound should take extreme caution. It can be weeks before blood levels decline should a problem become evident. Trenbolone is also much more potent than testosterone at suppressing endogenous androgen production. This makes clear the fact that estrogen is not the only culprit with negative feedback inhibition, as here there is no buildup of this hormone to report here. There is however some activity as a progestin inherent in this compound, as trenbolone is a 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) derivative (a trait characteristic of these compounds). However it seems likely that much of its suppressive nature still stems from its powerful androgen action. With the strong impact trenbolone has on endogenous testosterone, of course the use of a stimulating drug such as HCG and/or Clomid/Nolvadex is recommended when concluding steroid therapy (a combination is preferred). Without their use it may take a prolonged period of time for the hormonal balance to resume, as the testes may at first not be able to normally respond to the resumed output of endogenous gonadotropins due to an atrophied state. Those who have used Parabolan regularly would often claim it to be indispensable. A weekly dosage of 3 ampules (228 mg) was the most popular range when running a cycle, however many did find it highly effective in lesser amounts. Although a weekly administration schedule would prove sufficient, athletes usually injected a single ampule per application, the total amount spread evenly throughout the week. While Parabolan is quite potent when used alone it was generally combined with other steroids for an even greater effect. Leading up to a show one could successfully add a non-aromatizing anabolic such as Winstrol or Primobolan. Such combinations will elicit a greater level density and hardness to the build, often proving dramatic to a stage appearance. We could also look for bulk with this drug, and addition stronger compounds like Dianabol or Testosterone. While the mass gain would be quite formidable with such a stack, some level of water retention would probably also accompany it. Moderately effective anabolics such Deca-Durabolin or Equipoise would be somewhat of a halfway point, providing extra strength and mass but without the same level of water bloat we see with more readily aromatized steroids. The main problem with Parabolan historically was that it had always been extremely difficult to obtain. While it was manufactured the demand for this drug was huge. On top of that it was also often scarcely available because it was made only in limited lots in France. Now even in the former country of production, none can be found. Some counterfeits still circulate today, so it is important to stress the fact that you can no longer find legitimate Parabolan on the black market.</p>","<div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><div><pre>Trenabol Depot 100 (trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate), 100 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon</pre></div></div></div></div><p id=""availability_statut""> </p>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 01:36:32",1,open,81,,,no,no,,95,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/trenabol-depot-100.jpg ! alt :  ! title : trenabol-depot-100 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/trenabol-depot-100/,5,,,,,,,,,,,simple,featured,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Trenbolone (Acetate, Enanthate)","buy trenabol depot",

Testosterone-Enanthate is one of the most versatile anabolic androgenic steroids one could ever use as it is for all intense purposes the perfect steroid for almost any purpose. Highly anabolic and androgenic in nature, with a rating of 100 in each, as are all testosterone forms, as the demand for this hormone is very high as is the supply you will find Testosterone-Enanthate to be one of the more easily affordable anabolic steroids on the market. From bodybuilders to power lifters, to on the field athletes and gym rats and everything in-between if you find an individual who has supplemented with anabolic steroids before and in the U.S. you’ll find over six-million who do so simply for cosmetic purposes then you’ll find a strong majority have supplemented with Testosterone-Enanthate.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>To understand Testosterone-Enanthate we only need to understand two things; the testosterone hormone and the Enanthate ester. In-fact, when we understand the testosterone hormone we will largely understand each and every form of exogenous testosterone as the hormone itself is identically the same in all types. The ester, in this case Enanthate is not a hormone, the ester does not provide any physical benefit that you desire to obtain. The ester does play an important role when attached to a testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid and the ester attached can vary greatly; however, in short, the ester is what largely determines the hormones initial and total activity and you will generally find that to be the only point of interest in its regards. While it should be clear it bears worth repeating; testosterone is simply testosterone, the form does not change the hormone; Testosterone-Enanthate, Testosterone-Propionate, mixtures such as Sustanon-250 or Omnadren, they are all comprised of the same active testosterone hormone; only the ester(s) are different, only the esters vary but the testosterone hormone remains the same. For years testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids in general have received a lot of bad press in popular culture, much of it based on a simple lack of education but as we understand the world isn’t flat we also understand many things about the testosterone hormone. Testosterone is a hormone naturally produced by both men and women; regardless of your thoughts and opinions on anabolic steroids you produce testosterone whether you like it or not. Individual production can vary greatly from one person to the next, there is no standard amount but men will generally produce ten times the amount as women but it remains essential to health and function for both sexes. In-fact, the testosterone hormone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce; without the hormone we cannot function properly and in the way a human being was intended to. Testosterone is responsible for many functions and aspects of the human body including those of both a physical and mental nature and when levels fall below an optimal range the individual can suffer greatly. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone levels commonly do so because of age. As we age our natural testosterone production declines, this is especially true for men but in many cases for post-menopausal women as well. Individuals who suffer will find such issues as loss in strength and muscle tissue, increases of excess body-fat, lethargy, depression, decreased libido, an inability to perform sexually, a weakened immune system to a host of other issues; does testosterone sound a little important yet? For the individual who suffers from low levels of testosterone remedy is easily available and often <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> can be the answer to this call, as Testosterone-Enanthate is just that, pure testosterone. Of course for the performance enhancer improving low levels is not really the goal; for the performance enhancer the idea is to surpass normal levels so as to enhance the attributes the hormone carries. Regardless of the purpose of use, be it performance enhancement or TRT the mode of action within the hormone remains the same. By its very nature as a pure testosterone, Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it many traits from increasing nitrogen retention and protein synthesis, thereby promoting tissue growth and regeneration and of equal importance preservation. That alone is enough to make testosterone extremely valuable but it hardly ends there. The testosterone hormone is also responsible for many metabolic traits and a large portion of our overall metabolic activity; and while the above plays an intrinsic role it is only a scratching the surface. Through the use of supplemental Testosterone-Enanthate we increase our testosterone levels enabling the hormone to perform a much needed action in inhibiting the release as well as reducing the amount of stress hormones we have in the body; more specifically glucocorticoid hormones. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly referred to as muscle wasting hormones as they destroy muscle tissue and greatly promote increases in excess body-fat. If that’s not enough the direct mode of action of the testosterone hormone continues to gain in power and importance but as you can see the importance is already there. When we supplement with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em>, especially in doses beyond therapeutic measure we greatly increase the amount of IGF-1 released into the body. IGF-1 is another very powerful yet naturally produced anabolic hormone and is so essential to health and function that it affects almost every single cell within the human body. As you now have a good understanding of the function and purpose of the testosterone hormone you can now begin to understand how the ester affects it and as we are only concerned with Testosterone-Enanthate it is the Enanthate ester we will look at and how it works when attached. Testosterone-Enanthate is a slow acting yet long lasting in effect testosterone form. This time factor is created by the Enanthate ester that is attached and as the Enanthate ester is fairly large so is its total half-life. The half-life of Testosterone-Enanthate is approximately 10.5 days and that is a fairly decently long half-life; in-fact, the only single ester based testosterone most will use that has a longer half-life is Testosterone-Cypionate and its half-life is only about 36 hours longer. As a large ester based anabolic steroid Testosterone-Enanthate will not require frequent injections. For the TRT patient generally one injection every week will be sufficient while most performance enhancers will find two injections of equal dosing per week to be just about perfect. Most performance enhancers will choose to inject on the same two days each week, for example, Monday and Thursday and the same can be said of the TRT patient, on the same day each week and you are advised to do the same.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>If you suffer from low testosterone, in most cases Testosterone-Enanthate will provide you with every last benefit you could ever need or desire. For the performance enhancer the exact same thing can be said; in-fact, Testosterone-Enanthate will provide almost every benefit an anabolic steroid can bring, for as you recall it is one of the most versatile hormones of all. Through the use of Testosterone-Enanthate and the increased levels of testosterone now in the body we have created the perfect playing field that will lend to the promotion of mass and strength and not just mass but quality muscle tissue. Further, as it is responsible for a large portion of total metabolic activity our overall metabolic efficiency is enhanced, allowing us to lose excess body-fat more effectively or build more lean tissue if we so desire without the excess addition of body-fat that often accompany it. Of equal importance Testosterone-Enanthate will greatly improve our recovery capabilities and for the athlete this is of great importance, for it is in the recovery process that progress is made; weight training and physical stimulation is just that but it is the recovery from such events that causes the body to regenerate to a stronger degree; with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em> we are able to enhance this factor. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone there may be parts of this that sound very distasteful; after all, the majority of people have no desire to build a lot of muscle, they do not desire a freaky look and for you there’s good news; supplementing with Testosterone-Enanthate will not provide this on its own, therefore you have nothing to fear. Yes, Testosterone-Enanthate can greatly aid in this purpose if you so desire but you must do other things as well in-order to meet this end. More importantly, when we speak of increasing muscle mass somehow in popular culture this has been deemed only as “massive piles” and as a negative attribute when nothing could be further from the truth. You need some level of muscle tissue on your frame in-order to simply function, further, lean muscle mass greatly affects your metabolism; how much of it you have is largely up to you but too little is never a good thing. In short, to be big you have to eat big, you have to train big but the intake of food plays the biggest role of all. If you have no desire to have a bodybuilding type physique then simply don’t eat like a bodybuilder and even then you shouldn’t really expect one outright; after all, you’d never say “I want to play golf but I don’t want to be as good as Tiger Woods” of course not, that is ridiculous for numerous reasons. Testosterone-Enanthate also presents to us another very useful benefit and it remains so regardless of the testosterone form being used; the preservation of muscle tissue. When we diet in-order to lose excess body-fat some muscle mass is going to be lost but as mentioned the more muscle mass we possess the greater our metabolic activity. Fortunately testosterone protects and preserves lean tissue, especially when calories are low and fat is being burned. Not only is muscle tissue protected but as our metabolism is also being improved in general we thereby have a more pleasing physique looking back at us in the mirror.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>As exogenous testosterone is one of the most highly well-tolerated hormones any man can ever supplement with the probability of adverse side-effects is fairly low when use is done in a responsible manner. However, testosterone is so well-tolerated that even in supraphysiological doses it can be used without a negative effect; this is such an important piece of information we must delve into it in its own section later on. While use can be very safe there are potential <strong>side-effects</strong> we must be aware of and as Testosterone-Enanthate is simply pure testosterone the potential side-effects will largely be of an estrogenic nature. When testosterone is present in the body it inevitably converts to estrogen via the aromatase process. Through this conversion some of the most commonly well-known anabolic steroid related side-effects can occur including Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues. While there is no way to predict if you will fall prey it is always important to remember total dosing can play a large role; after all, if there’s more testosterone to convert into estrogen the larger the potential buildup is. For those who are sensitive to such effects anti-estrogen medications can often be their saving grace and there are none better than aromatase inhibitors (AI’s) such as Arimidex and Letrozole. AI’s do exactly what their name implies, inhibit the aromatase process; that is correct, they stop the conversion process but they have also been shown to actually reduce the total amount of estrogen in the body as well. It is true, while the use of an AI will in most cases keep an individual free and clear of such effects in a small minority it will not but in most cases if you examine your diet, ensure it is rich in omega fatty acids, ensure your carbohydrate consumption isn’t above need, ensure dosing is adequate but not too high you will normally be absolutely fine. While Testosterone-Enanthate is generally well-tolerated there is one side-effect assured to occur in all men and it is that of testicular atrophy; however, as horrific as it might sound we cannot aptly label it an adverse effect. When we supplement with exogenous testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid our natural <strong>testosterone levels</strong> are suppressed, production is reduced and our testicles shrink. No, our testicles do not shrink into thin air, they simply lose some of their fullness but it is only temporary. Once all anabolic steroid use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks, natural production will begin again and the testicles will return to their normal size. Further, while exogenous hormones are being used and natural production is suppressed, if we are using Testosterone-Enanthate we have no chance in suffering from low level symptoms because we are providing our body and in many cases more testosterone than it already needs for proper health and function. It must be noted, for the TRT patient as he will likely remain on therapy the rest of his life there will be no breaks and testicular atrophy will remain.</p><h3>The New England Journal of Medicine:</h3><p>You’ve heard the stories; steroids will kill you, steroids will turn you into a raging lunatic, steroids will rot your brain, explode your heart and everything in-between and if you ask anyone with half a brain none of this sounds like too much fun. Even so, the question remains, is it the truth? We know from a simple look at statistics that there has never been a death directly caused by anabolic androgenic steroids and we have seen evidence that destroys many of the supposed health concerns time and time again but none is more telling than the 1996 study done by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) titled “The Effects of Supraphysiological Doses of Testosterone on Muscle Size and Strength in Normal Men.” To this day it is one of the more thorough studies regarding <strong>anabolic steroid</strong> use, one done not only in a controlled manner but without emotional bias; only the facts are present. More importantly the term “Supraphysiological” refers to doses beyond therapeutic; that’s right, in the case of the NEJM study we’re talking about performance enhancement. While you can find the full study on the NEJM website a brief overview and summary will give you a good understanding. 40 men ages 19-49 were placed in four groups of ten. None of the men had ever supplemented with anabolic androgenic steroids or used any recreational drug and each man was free from any psychiatric or behavioral disorder. All 40 men were of reasonable good health and broken down into the four following categories:</p><ul><li>Group One: Placebo with no exercise</li><li>Group Two: Testosterone with no exercise</li><li>Group Three: Placebo with exercise</li><li>Group Four: Testosterone with exercise</li></ul><p>Each man was instructed to follow a diet based on standardized RDA requirements and such diets were monitored closely for several weeks until the actual testing began. In the test the men not given testosterone is a simple result, they were given no testosterone and are of little concern here; however, you can again see the full results of the study on the NEJM website but here we are only concerned with the 20 men who actually received <strong>testosterone injections</strong>. Of the 20 men each received 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for a total of 10 weeks; keep in mind, 600mg per week is generally three times the amount of the standard highest therapeutic dose given to most patients who suffer from low testosterone; again, this is very much a performance level dosing. Of the 20 men who received the Testosterone-Enanthate the physical results of a positive nature were akin to the benefits we have explained here; increases in strength, muscle tissue, decreases in body-fat, etc. While that’s all well and fine what most people want to know about is the side-effects and this is where things get interesting; after all, it’s no secret that anabolic steroids work. In the study, of the 20 men who were given 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for 10 weeks no one died, no one had a heart attack and no one had a stroke; but what about the specific health effects?</p><ul><li>“The serum liver-enzyme concentrations, hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrits, and red-cell counts did not change in any study group”</li><li>“Plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides did not change in any study group”</li><li>“There was no change in the serum concentration of prostate-specific antigen in any group”</li><li>“No significant changes in mood or behavior were reported by the men on the Mood Inventory or by their live-in partners, spouses, or parents on the Observer Mood Inventory”</li></ul><p>The results of the test speak for themselves.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Be it for the purpose of performance enhancing, bulking or cutting, be it for the purpose of treating low testosterone you will be hard pressed to find anything better than pure testosterone and luckily for you that’s exactly what Testosterone-Enanthate is. For the performance enhancer generally 500mg per week of <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> is a good standard dose, especially for a beginner but for many seasoned veterans as well. 500mg per week can be used very safely and with very good results and is an excellent foundation for any anabolic steroid stack; in-fact, regardless of your dose testosterone in general is always the best foundational stone. While 500mg is a quality amount that will do more for you than you could ever hope for without, many will supplement with more and doses upwards of 1,000mg per week are not uncommon among the veteran hardcore. While there is no way we can recommend such doses outright many seem to be fine with them but long-term evidence and studies are lacking in this regard to say with any assured certainty. Further, as we have explained, when doses increase so does the probability of negative effects so if you choose to supplement this high you must proceed with extra caution. For the average man even in a hardcore sense 1,000mg per week is about as high as he’ll ever go, in the elite level, especially in competitive bodybuilding doses can get much higher but some level of an adverse reaction is almost guaranteed when it does. Remember, responsible use will always be your best friend and responsible use will include periods of discontinuing use and will be accompanied by a quality <strong>Post Cycle Therapy</strong> (PCT) plan. A PCT plan is designed not only to aid in normalizing your body but further to stimulate the production of the essential testosterone hormone. While no PCT will in its own right bring production back to 100% it will send you on your way to just that much faster than without and the sooner this can be achieved the healthier you’ll be as well as more of your progress will be maintained. A quality PCT will always include a quality SERM such as Nolvadex or Clomid and often will include the greatly beneficial hCGhormone.</p>","<div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Testabol Enanthate (testosterone enanthate), 250 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon</pre></div></div><pre id=""availability_statut""> </pre>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 01:37:58",1,open,83,,,no,no,,85,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/testabol-enanthate.jpg ! alt :  ! title : testabol-enanthate ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/testabol-enanthate/,69,,,,,,,,,,,simple,featured,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Testosterone Enanthate","buy testabol enanthate",

It's reserved for treating severe acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring) that hasn't improved with standard treatment involving oral antibiotics and topical medicines.</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">How does isotretinoin work?</h3><p class=""body-text"">Isotretinoin belongs to a group of medicines known as retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A. Isotretinoin taken by mouth works by reducing the production of the skin's natural oil (sebum).</p><p class=""body-text"">Acne occurs due to an excessive production of sebum from over-active sebaceous glands in the skin. The sebum blocks the sebaceous glands, which prevents the oil from flowing freely out and causes an accumulation of sebum under the skin. The bacteria associated with acne thrive in these conditions. They feed on the sebum, and produce waste products and fatty acids that irritate the sebaceous glands, making them inflamed and causing spots.</p><p class=""body-text"">Isotretinoin decreases the size and activity of the sebaceous glands in the skin, which reduces the amount of sebum that is produced. This stops the glands becoming blocked, and means bacteria are less likely to thrive. It also reduces the inflammation in the skin.</p><h4 class=""body-h4"">How long does isotretinoin take to work?</h4><p class=""body-text"">Your acne may get worse when you first start taking isotretinoin, but this usually improves within 7 to 10 days of continued treatment. In most cases, complete or near-complete clearing of acne is achieved with a 16 to 24 week course of treatment, and you're then likely to remain free of acne for a long time. Repeat courses are not normally recommended, unless a definite relapse is seen after treatment is stopped. Repeat courses should not be started until at least eight weeks after stopping treatment, as your acne may still improve in this time.</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">How do I take isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>The isotretinoin dose prescribed and how often to take it varies from person to person. Always follow the instructions given by your doctor. These will be printed on the dispensing label that your pharmacist has put on the medicine.</li><li>Isotretinoin capsules are usually taken once or twice a day. The capsules should be swallowed whole with a drink, either with or just after food (on a full stomach).</li><li>If you forget to take a dose take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as usual when it's due. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">What should I know before taking isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Isotretinoin causes major birth defects (serious malformations of a developing foetus) if taken during pregnancy and there are some strict rules to avoid a developing baby being accidentally exposed to it. Your doctor will not prescribe this medicine to women who could get pregnant, unless the following conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met:<ul><li>Women must use at least one, but preferably two (for example the pill and condoms), effective methods of contraception at all times to prevent pregnancy.</li><li>Contraception must start at least four weeks before starting treatment, be used at all times during treatment and for at least four weeks after stopping isotretinoin, even if you don't have a period.</li><li>Your doctor can't prescribe isotretinoin until you have been using effective contraception for at least a month and have had a negative pregnancy test.</li><li>Your doctor is only allowed to prescribe 30 days supply of isotretinoin at a time, and the prescription will only be valid for seven days.</li><li>You will need to have a follow-up visit every month, at which you will have to have a pregnancy test that must come back negative before a new prescription can be issued.</li><li>Five weeks after stopping treatment you should have a final pregnancy test to make sure you have not fallen pregnant. If you think there is a chance you could be pregnant, either during treatment, or in the first month after stopping treatment, you must consult your doctor immediately.</li></ul></li><li>There is no evidence to suggest that children fathered by men who are taking isotretinoin will be affected by the medicine, but men should remember not to share this medicine with anyone, particularly females.</li><li>You should never give isotretinoin to another person and you should return any unused medicine to your pharmacist at the end of treatment.</li><li>People taking isotretinoin must not donate blood during treatment, and for at least four weeks after stopping treatment. This is due to the potential risk of the medicine to an unborn child if a transfusion of your blood was given to a pregnant woman.</li><li>Avoid exposing your skin to intense sunlight or UV light while taking isotretinoin. Use a sunscreen of at least SPF 15 even on a bright but cloudy day. Do not use sunbeds.</li><li>Isotretinoin is likely to make your skin and lips very dry, so it's recommended that you use a moisturiser and lip balm from the start of treatment.</li><li>Avoid waxing any part of your body while taking isotretinoin, and for at least six months after stopping treatment, as this could strip the top layer of skin. Chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should also be avoided during treatment and for five to six months after stopping isotretinoin, as this could cause scarring.</li><li>Isotretinoin can make your eyes dry. This can be relieved with artificial tear drops. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If you wear contact lenses you may find that they become uncomfortable during treatment and you have to wear glasses instead.</li><li>Decreased night vision may also occur during treatment and after stopping isotretinoin, and can occur suddenly. For this reason you are advised to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. If you experience any visual difficulties, inform your doctor so that your vision can be monitored. It may sometimes be necessary to stop treatment.</li><li>It's usually fine to drink alcohol within recommended guidelines while you're taking isotretinoin, although do always check this with your doctor first.</li><li>Isotretinoin may rarely cause depression, anxiety, aggression and mood changesand very rarely psychotic symptoms (eg delusions or hallucinations) and thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts. Make sure your doctor knows if you have ever suffered from depression. If you start to feel depressed, or experience any other changes in your mood or behaviour during treatment, it is very important to talk to your doctor straight away.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">What other monitoring do I need while taking isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>You will need to have blood tests to monitor your liver function and the amount of lipids (fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides) in your blood before you start treatment with isotretinoin, one month after starting and then at further three-monthly intervals.</li><li>Isotretinoin may increase your blood sugar level. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood sugar level if you are overweight, have diabetes or suffer from alcoholism.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">Who shouldn't take isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li><li>Woman who could get pregnant, unless all the criteria described above are met.</li><li>Children under 12 years of age, and children with acne that has developed before reaching puberty.</li><li>People with liver problems.</li><li>People with high levels of fats (lipids) such as cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood (hyperlipidaemia).</li><li>People with a condition resulting from the excessive consumption of vitamin A (hypervitaminosis A).</li><li>People taking tetracycline-type antibiotics.</li><li>People who are allergic to any of the ingredients. Check the ingredients listed in the leaflet that comes with the medicine if you know you have specific allergies or intolerances.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">What are the possible side effects of isotretinoin?</h3><p class=""body-text"">Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with isotretinoin. Just because a side effect is stated here doesn't mean that all people taking isotretinoin will experience that or any side effect.</p><h4 class=""body-h4"">Very common (affect more than 1 in 10 people)</h4><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Dry skin (causing inflammation, peeling, itching, increased skin fragility - see warnings above).</li><li>Dry, inflamed and cracked lips.</li><li>Dry eyes (causing eye irritation, conjunctivitis or inflammation of the eyelids - see warnings above).</li><li>Pain in the muscles and joints, particularly in adolescents. You should minimise the amount of vigorous physical activity you do while taking isotretinoin.</li><li>Anaemia.</li><li>Changes in the numbers of blood cells called platelets in the blood.</li><li>Increased level of fats called triglycerides in the blood.</li><li>Increased liver enzymes.</li></ul><h4 class=""body-h4"">Common (affect between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people)</h4><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Dryness of the lining of the nose (causing nasal inflammation and nosebleeds).</li><li>Headache.</li><li>Decreased numbers of white blood cells in the blood.</li><li>Increased levels of sugar and cholesterol in the blood.</li><li>Presence of blood or protein in the urine.</li></ul><h4 class=""body-h4"">Rare (affect between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000 people)</h4><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Mood changes, anxiety, aggressive tendencies or depression (see warning above).</li><li>Hair loss (alopecia).</li><li>Allergic reactions.</li></ul><h4 class=""body-h4"">Very rare (affect fewer than 1 in 10,000 people)</h4><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Increased sensitivity of the skin to UV light (photosensitivity - see warning above).</li><li>Increased pigmentation in the skin.</li><li>Increased sweating.</li><li>Visual disturbances (eg blurred vision, cataracts, colour blindness, decreased night vision, dislike of light). See warning above.</li><li>Inflammation of the surface of the eye (keratitis).</li><li>Hearing problems.</li><li>Dry throat, hoarseness.</li><li>Swollen glands.</li><li>Diabetes.</li><li>Convulsions.</li><li>Drowsiness.</li><li>Dizziness.</li><li>Abnormal behaviour, psychotic disorders, eg with delusions or hallucinations, or suicidal feelings or thoughts. See warning above.</li><li>Raised pressure inside the skull, called benign intracranial hypertension. Stop taking isotretinoin and consult a doctor immediately if you experience a severe headache, together with nausea, vomiting and visual disturbances while taking it.</li><li>Breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm, particularly in people with asthma).</li><li>Inflammatory bowel disease. Stop taking isotretinoin and consult your doctor straight away if you get severe diarrhoea, particularly if it contains blood, during treatment.</li><li>Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), liver (hepatitis) or kidneys (glomerulonephritis).</li><li>Bone disorders such as arthritis, increased growth of bone, reduced bone density, or calcification of tendons or ligaments.</li><li>Inflammation of tendons (tendonitis).</li></ul><p class=""body-text"">Isotretinoin has been associated with causing some severe, potentially life-threatening skin reactions that require immediate medical treatment. It's important to stop taking isotretinoin and consult your doctor immediately if you develop a skin rash or other related symptoms during treatment. These types of skin rash appear initially as circular patches, often with central blisters usually on arms and hands or legs and feet. More severe rashes may include blistering of the chest and back. Additional symptoms such as eye infections (conjunctivitis) or ulcers of the mouth, throat or nose may occur. Severe forms of rash may progress to widespread peeling of the skin which can be life-threatening. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by headache, fever and body aches (flu-like symptoms).</p><p class=""body-text"">Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you want any more information about the possible side effects of isotretinoin. If you think you have experienced a side effect, did you know you can report this using the yellow card website?</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">Can I take other medicines with isotretinoin?</h3><p class=""body-text"">It's important to tell your doctor or pharmacist what medicines you are already taking, including those bought without a prescription and herbal medicines, before you start treatment with isotretinoin. Similarly, check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medicines with isotretinoin, to make sure that the combination is safe.</p><p class=""body-text"">Tetracycline-type antibiotics, eg minocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, must not be taken with isotretinoin.</p><p class=""body-text"">Do not take vitamin A supplements (including multivitamins containing vitamin A) while you're taking isotretinoin, as this may result in a condition similar to vitamin A overdose, which may cause changes in the structure of the bone.</p><p class=""body-text"">Other treatments conventionally used for acne, including antibiotics, exfoliants, medicines which loosen the dead skin on the skin surface (keratolytics), or radiation therapy with ultraviolet light (PUVA), should be avoided while taking isotretinoin. However, non-irritant preparations can be applied to the skin if necessary and it's fine to use moisturisers.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">20mg (30 caps.)</span>

In this case just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as usual when it's due. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">What should I know before taking isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Isotretinoin causes major birth defects (serious malformations of a developing foetus) if taken during pregnancy and there are some strict rules to avoid a developing baby being accidentally exposed to it. Your doctor will not prescribe this medicine to women who could get pregnant, unless the following conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met:<ul><li>Women must use at least one, but preferably two (for example the pill and condoms), effective methods of contraception at all times to prevent pregnancy.</li><li>Contraception must start at least four weeks before starting treatment, be used at all times during treatment and for at least four weeks after stopping isotretinoin, even if you don't have a period.</li><li>Your doctor can't prescribe isotretinoin until you have been using effective contraception for at least a month and have had a negative pregnancy test.</li><li>Your doctor is only allowed to prescribe 30 days supply of isotretinoin at a time, and the prescription will only be valid for seven days.</li><li>You will need to have a follow-up visit every month, at which you will have to have a pregnancy test that must come back negative before a new prescription can be issued.</li><li>Five weeks after stopping treatment you should have a final pregnancy test to make sure you have not fallen pregnant. If you think there is a chance you could be pregnant, either during treatment, or in the first month after stopping treatment, you must consult your doctor immediately.</li></ul></li><li>There is no evidence to suggest that children fathered by men who are taking isotretinoin will be affected by the medicine, but men should remember not to share this medicine with anyone, particularly females.</li><li>You should never give isotretinoin to another person and you should return any unused medicine to your pharmacist at the end of treatment.</li><li>People taking isotretinoin must not donate blood during treatment, and for at least four weeks after stopping treatment. This is due to the potential risk of the medicine to an unborn child if a transfusion of your blood was given to a pregnant woman.</li><li>Avoid exposing your skin to intense sunlight or UV light while taking isotretinoin. Use a sunscreen of at least SPF 15 even on a bright but cloudy day. Do not use sunbeds.</li><li>Isotretinoin is likely to make your skin and lips very dry, so it's recommended that you use a moisturiser and lip balm from the start of treatment.</li><li>Avoid waxing any part of your body while taking isotretinoin, and for at least six months after stopping treatment, as this could strip the top layer of skin. Chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should also be avoided during treatment and for five to six months after stopping isotretinoin, as this could cause scarring.</li><li>Isotretinoin can make your eyes dry. This can be relieved with artificial tear drops. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If you wear contact lenses you may find that they become uncomfortable during treatment and you have to wear glasses instead.</li><li>Decreased night vision may also occur during treatment and after stopping isotretinoin, and can occur suddenly. For this reason you are advised to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. If you experience any visual difficulties, inform your doctor so that your vision can be monitored. It may sometimes be necessary to stop treatment.</li><li>It's usually fine to drink alcohol within recommended guidelines while you're taking isotretinoin, although do always check this with your doctor first.</li><li>Isotretinoin may rarely cause depression, anxiety, aggression and mood changesand very rarely psychotic symptoms (eg delusions or hallucinations) and thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts. Make sure your doctor knows if you have ever suffered from depression. If you start to feel depressed, or experience any other changes in your mood or behaviour during treatment, it is very important to talk to your doctor straight away.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">What other monitoring do I need while taking isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>You will need to have blood tests to monitor your liver function and the amount of lipids (fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides) in your blood before you start treatment with isotretinoin, one month after starting and then at further three-monthly intervals.</li><li>Isotretinoin may increase your blood sugar level. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood sugar level if you are overweight, have diabetes or suffer from alcoholism.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">Who shouldn't take isotretinoin?</h3><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li><li>Woman who could get pregnant, unless all the criteria described above are met.</li><li>Children under 12 years of age, and children with acne that has developed before reaching puberty.</li><li>People with liver problems.</li><li>People with high levels of fats (lipids) such as cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood (hyperlipidaemia).</li><li>People with a condition resulting from the excessive consumption of vitamin A (hypervitaminosis A).</li><li>People taking tetracycline-type antibiotics.</li><li>People who are allergic to any of the ingredients. Check the ingredients listed in the leaflet that comes with the medicine if you know you have specific allergies or intolerances.</li></ul><h3 class=""body-h3"">What are the possible side effects of isotretinoin?</h3><p class=""body-text"">Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with isotretinoin. Just because a side effect is stated here doesn't mean that all people taking isotretinoin will experience that or any side effect.</p><h4 class=""body-h4"">Very common (affect more than 1 in 10 people)</h4><ul class=""body-ul""><li>Dry skin (causing inflammation, peeling, itching, increased skin fragility - see warnings above).</li><li>Dry, inflamed and cracked lips.</li><li>Dry eyes (causing eye irritation, conjunctivitis or inflammation of the eyelids - see warnings above).</li><li>Pain in the muscles and joints, particularly in adolescents.

It's important to stop taking isotretinoin and consult your doctor immediately if you develop a skin rash or other related symptoms during treatment. These types of skin rash appear initially as circular patches, often with central blisters usually on arms and hands or legs and feet. More severe rashes may include blistering of the chest and back. Additional symptoms such as eye infections (conjunctivitis) or ulcers of the mouth, throat or nose may occur. Severe forms of rash may progress to widespread peeling of the skin which can be life-threatening. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by headache, fever and body aches (flu-like symptoms).</p><p class=""body-text"">Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you want any more information about the possible side effects of isotretinoin. If you think you have experienced a side effect, did you know you can report this using the yellow card website?</p><h3 class=""body-h3"">Can I take other medicines with isotretinoin?</h3><p class=""body-text"">It's important to tell your doctor or pharmacist what medicines you are already taking, including those bought without a prescription and herbal medicines, before you start treatment with isotretinoin. Similarly, check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medicines with isotretinoin, to make sure that the combination is safe.</p><p class=""body-text"">Tetracycline-type antibiotics, eg minocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, must not be taken with isotretinoin.</p><p class=""body-text"">Do not take vitamin A supplements (including multivitamins containing vitamin A) while you're taking isotretinoin, as this may result in a condition similar to vitamin A overdose, which may cause changes in the structure of the bone.</p><p class=""body-text"">Other treatments conventionally used for acne, including antibiotics, exfoliants, medicines which loosen the dead skin on the skin surface (keratolytics), or radiation therapy with ultraviolet light (PUVA), should be avoided while taking isotretinoin. However, non-irritant preparations can be applied to the skin if necessary and it's fine to use moisturisers.</p>","<pre><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">20mg (30 caps.)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Isotretinoin Actavis 20mg (isotretinoin)

there is truly nothing else quite like it! Originally brought to us by Ciba Pharmaceuticals, thanks to U.S. Olympic Team doctor John Zeigler, Dianabolor Dbol as it is commonly known was the first oral anabolic steroid ever created. While manyanabolic steroids were first synthesized with a therapeutic medical purpose in mind this is not the case with <strong>Dbol</strong>, in-fact, Dianabol was brought forth for one reason and one reason only, performance enhancement and with that in mind you better believe it held up to the desired end. For years the Soviet Union had dominated U.S. Olympic Teams through their use of testosterone and Dr. Ziegler was charged with coming up with an answer and his answer was one of the most powerful anabolic steroids ever created and to this day it remains so. Originally and to this day a favorite among competitive bodybuilders and power lifters for its ability to add massive amounts of raw size and strength, since its inception Dianabol has found a more than welcomed home in almost every athletic circle and just as its demand was high in the 1960s its demand remains high today if not higher.</p><h3>Dianabol:</h3><p>Highly anabolic with a moderate androgenic<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#69472761""> nature<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> Dianabol is comprised of the active steroidal hormone <strong>Methandrostenolone</strong> yet generally carries the popular trade name Dianabol, as is common in the anabolic steroid world. Well-suited for gains in both strength and size, by its very nature Dianabol by way of action through the androgen receptors greatly and dramatically increases protein synthesis and glycogenolysis, much more so than most other anabolic steroids and at a much faster rate. An anabolic steroid that generally comes in an oral tablet form, it can be found in an oral liquid state and<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#47448638""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> as an injectable solution but both are rare and 99% of all Methandrostenolone will be in the oral tablet form. As is the nature of most oral anabolic steroid tablets Dianabol belongs to the class known as 17-aa or 17 Alpha-Alkylated. In this particular instance this means the Methandrostenolone steroid has been altered at the 17th carbon position in order to allow the steroid to survive the first pass through the liver after ingestion. Without the 17-aa alteration this steroid would be useless as it would be destroyed by the body before it could ever enter into the blood stream. However, as is with most 17-aa steroids Dianabol is toxic to the liver and while the level of toxicity will vary greatly from one oral steroid to the next in the case of Dbol we have one of the more potent and toxic anabolics in our hand; the most toxic, not<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#1010176""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> close but far more than most. While liver toxicity can be a big concern, with responsible use such concern can be eliminated; Dianabol has been shown to only be effective for short periods of time and while liver values may increase when use is in place they will almost always drop back down to their original state once use is discontinued. How bad or strong is this liver toxicity; we cannot give you an exact number as liver values will vary from person to person and dosing will also play a large role; however, we can say with certainty that 50mg of Dianabol a day is not as toxic as daily alcohol consumption and its not even close. Most who supplement with this steroid will find 6 weeks of use to be the maximal duration and highly efficient, as well as generally safe; use that extends past the 6 week mark will often be a waste as the body will no longer respond to the hormone and a break from use must take place.</p><h3>The Benefits of Dianabol:</h3><p>As Dianabol was designed specifically for athletes and performance it should come as no surprise that the benefits which may be reaped are perfect for just that; athletic performance. It is true, Dianabol is not the only steroid we can say this about but most anabolic steroids were developed to treat a particular disease or ailment and often performance is a secondary concern if at all and while other steroids may have performance in mind to a degree, as it pertains to Dianabol this was the only thing in mind. While <strong>Dianabol</strong> provides many benefits, in simple terms the most<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#23063043""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> of all is in its ability to provide a rapid increase in fat-free mass and that means pure lean muscle tissue. As you recall Dbol greatly increases protein synthesis, a trait shared by most all anabolic steroids only here it is more pronounced but it is in Dianabols ability to greatly increase glycogenolysis that really sets it apart. Again, in simple terms this increase in glycogenolysis means your carbohydrates become more valuable, each and every gram of carbohydrates is utilized to a higher degree when Methandrostenolone is present in the body, far beyond what it could ever be in its absence regardless of how well you eat. For this reason, especially in competitive bodybuilding circles Dbol has remained a staple for many off-season bulking cycles as carbohydrate intake is normally much higher in the off-season than it is when dieting. Not only is this factor important in-terms of size gains but as carbohydrates are raw energy, this is their primary responsibility, we greatly increase our raw energy and translate it into an increase in strength and often dramatically so. While these benefits are all truly great it does not end there; Dianabol further dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles of the body, as do most anabolic steroids but once again the rate in-which Dianabol pulls this off is nearly tenfold. From reading about these benefits the most obvious question is how truly great are they, can an actual number be provided that gives the above a little more weight? It is imperative to note, Dianabol will not cause a massive gain in size without enough fuel to perform the tasks at hand; however, even in a caloric deficit some increase in lean tissue and strength can occur. For those following a solid bulking diet and by solid we do not necessarily mean one that is massive, gains of 20-3olbs are not uncommon, in-fact theyre quite common with gains that surpass this mark while a little rarer not being unheard of. As is with most steroids Dianabol has one primary role but can serve more than one purpose, meaning in this case, yes, Dianabol can be used and used successfully when dieting and trying to lean out and this is not as uncommon as you might think. Competitive bodybuilders and power lifters will sometimes supplement with Dbol when dieting in order to maintain strength while in a caloric deficit; this can be very beneficial to a power lifter who needs to lose weight in-order to meet a desired weight class. Not only will dieting use of this steroid greatly aid in preserving strength but as often is the case it will greatly aid in preserving the tissue itself; as you can see, this is truly one amazing steroid.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Dianabol:</h3><p>All anabolic steroids carry with them the potential for adverse side-effects and like all things in life the extent of this potential and probability greatly varies from one steroid to the next. In Dianabol we have a very powerful steroid and as is common the more powerful the steroid the more potential there is for side-effects; its a tradeoff but keep in mind, potential side-effects in no way means guaranteed or assured. This is the case with any item you might buy at your local RX, each and every item carries with it the potential for side-effects, some more so than others and while some will experience negative side-effects from one item, lets say Tylenol, many others will not. However, while side-effects from varying medications can vary, when we compare and discuss hormones of a steroidal nature it is not always so cut and dry for with anabolic steroids more times than not side-effects can easily be avoided or protected against with responsible use, while with many over the counter (OTC) medications this is simply not true; in OTC meds you can either take it or you cant, end of story. As we discussed Dianabol is one of the more liver toxic steroids on the market but the effects of its action in-terms of increasing liver enzyme levels are 100% reversible, assuming responsible use is adhered to. While toxicity is indeed a concern that is hard to ignore, without question the greatest threat to Dbol use is high blood pressure; in-fact, of all the side-effects caused by <strong>anabolic steroids</strong>high blood pressure and Dianabol can often go hand-in-hand. If you suffer from preexisting high blood pressure you should not supplement with this steroid; theres simply no way around it and the simple truth is this steroid is not for you. However, for the healthy adult male, even at a high dose many will find blood pressure to be of very little concern; there is absolutely no way to predict if you will be one of the many lucky ones but a healthy diet rich in omega fats, low in saturated fats, with adequate yet not high sodium and low in sugar as well as with the use of an aromatase inhibitor can greatly aid you in this end. Other common side-effects associated with <em>Dianabol</em> include excess water retention andGynecomastia most notably and for this reason yet again an aromatase inhibitor is highly advised to control and prevent such effects. Keep in mind, as it pertains to water retention, as most will use this steroid while bulking if water retention occurs most will blame the brunt of it on the steroid and in many cases this is simply not true. Most simply overeat, particularly regarding their carbohydrate intake and as carbs cause you to hold excess water when they are consumed in abundance excess water retention exists. Further, if you are supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor in adequate and regular amounts and still suffering from high water retention you can guarantee you are simply overeating. As you can see, side-effects from this steroid are very easily controlled, however there is one more we must mention and this one is absolutely guaranteed. Dianabol will suppress your natural testosterone production and if you desire to keep an adequate <strong>level of testosterone</strong> in your system, as you should exogenous testosterone must be applied. This is however very good news, as both Dianabol and testosterone have been shown to work together in great synergy and with this added benefit any testosterone concern becomes no concern at all.</p><h3>Dianabol &amp; Anadrol:</h3><p>They are the two most common and popular oral steroids of all time and for the purpose of bulking there are few that can come close to the power of Dianabol and Anadrol. Both of these very powerful steroids are often discussed together and in many circles you will find fans of both and often fans of Anadrol will swear up and down it is the more powerful of the two; however, this is simply not true. On a milligram for milligram basis Dianabol is far stronger than Anadrol; in-fact, its not that close; yes, both are very powerful but Dianabol takes first prize handedly. This common misconception regarding the two steroids exists for one very simple reason and that is common dosing protocol. Most all cycles that include Anadrol will start at 50mg per day with 100mg per day being very common place, while conversely most <strong>Dianabol cycles</strong> will start at 20-30mg per day and while they often go up to 50mg in more hardcore circles, for the average gym rat it is rare. You rarely hear of anyone supplementing with 100mg of Dbol per day outside of elite level bodybuilding but if an individual were to take both steroids, one during the first cycle and the other in a second cycle and at equal doses in both, assuming both forms were of pure quality and all other variables remained the same the gains made from Dianabol would shadow Anadrol into the ground. In the end, while Dbol is more powerful you must find what works best for you, find which you tolerate to a higher degree, regardless of power your personal toleration is of the utmost importance.</p><h3>Dianabol Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For the majority of performance enhancers Dianabol will be used during an off-season bulking cycle; after all, by its nature it is primarily a bulking and strength increasing steroid; keep in mind, it can be used when cutting but bulking is where it truly shines. By its nature Dbol is a very fast acting steroid, so fast the effects can be seen in a matter of a few days; after a week there will be no question Dianabol is in your system and if you know anything about anabolic steroids then you understand this is very fast. However, as a fast acting steroid you may have already guessed it carries with it a very short half-life and youd be guessing right as this steroid carries with it a half-life of approximately<strong>5 hours</strong> making it one of the fastest acting and shortest lived anabolic androgenic steroids on the market. By this short half-life dosing of Dianabol should be multiple times per day reaching your total daily dose with the last dose spread out evenly throughout the day. It should come as no surprise, as this is a fast acting anabolic steroid many will choose Dianabol at the beginning of a cycle to kick the cycle off or what is often referred to as priming the cycle and while this is very effective and the most common place of use we must label another period of use superior. Dianabol is one of the best plateau busters on the market; with any cycle gains will come but at some point you will stagnate and changes must be made either in diet and training or in the anabolic stack; sometimes all three. However, in many cases if the individual simply added a little Dbol at the sticking point of the cycle they would see progress do just that, progress once again and if there is any place this steroid truly shines it is as a plateau buster while on cycle. The dosing of Dianabol can vary greatly but we can safely say to see any true anabolic affect <strong>20mg per day</strong> will prove to be the minimal dose with <strong>100mg per day</strong> being the maximal dose ever used and only used in certain circumstances by experienced steroid users. For the majority of performance enhancing athletes 50mg per day will prove to be all the Dbol they ever need and in some cases more than they need; if you are only looking for a slight bump in performance or size 50mg may indeed be too much. For the beginner most will find <strong>20-30mg per day</strong> to be all they need and in many cases all they ever want. There is one more factor we must discuss and this may be one of the most important of all and that is real Dianabol. Dianabol is one of the most common steroids on the black market, as its demand is very high and the raw powder from which it derives is one of the absolute cheapest to obtain. For those reasons you better believe there is a lot of under-dosed product on the market; demand is high and while powder is cheap most labs know suppliers are easily fooled and they will cut the tabs down to almost nothing and sell it to you at full price. It is somewhat rare for Dianabol to be outright counterfeited though, as powder is cheap theres not a lot of desire to counterfeit this product but in the name of greed it still occurs but it is low dosing that is the most common. Beware of where you purchase your Dianabol, always purchase human grade and always be aware of the laws as they pertain to where you live; follow these guidelines and youll save yourself a lot of trouble and enjoy one of the greatest steroids on earth.</p><h2>Dianabol Cycle</h2><p>The simple Dianabol cycle, while simple is one of the oldest and most popular anabolic steroid cycles of all time and for two simple reasons; it can produce amazing gains and rapidly so. Since its inception this little steroid pill has changed the face of athletics and physiques and while many othersteroids have come and gone Dbol as it is most commonly known has stood the test of time. When you stop and think about it this shouldn’t really come as a surprise; after all, the hormone was brought to the shelves for the strict purpose of athletic performance. This is worthy of note simply because most anabolic steroids were not first synthesized for performance enhancement purposes, although generally speaking most end up filling this role in a primary fashion. So what can a Dianabol cycle do for you? Let’s take a look and it’ll be easy to see why so many supplement with Dbol.</p><h3>Dianabol Cycle Benefits:</h3><p>Those who run a Dianabol cycle will most commonly do so during a period of off-season bulking. Yes, you can run a Dianabol cycle during your dieting phase and successfully so but due to the primary functions of the hormone it will best serve a gaining phase. Put simply the benefits of Dbol are increases in both muscle mass and strength. Individuals who supplement with this steroid can often gain as much as 20lbs in mere weeks, sometimes even more if enough calories are consumed. Further, many will see their strength shoot through the roof; even if calories are not that high ones strength will typically increase tremendously. When we break down the benefits of a Dianabol cycle more specifically one important trait the hormone carries is in its ability to dramatically increase glycogenolysis. An increase in glycogenolysis can be very important to an off-season athlete; put simply this means each gram of carbohydrates you consume becomes more valuable as they are used in a more efficient manner. In short, with this increase, as carbohydrates are a source of energy we are able to tap into and utilize our energy reserves more effectively; this effect is largely what causes the dramatic increase in strength.</p><h3>When to Run a Dianabol Cycle:</h3><p>Generally, in most cases a Dianabol cycle will take place the first few weeks of a total anabolic steroid cycle as part of a total stack; 4-6 weeks of use at the beginning of a cycle is very common place and very effective. The idea here is simply to kick start the cycle and provide gains and benefits quickly on the front end while the slower acting steroids are building in your system. This can be a very useful and beneficial period of use and while very beneficial there is another period of use that may be more important. A solid course of Dbol during the middle of a cycle can do some pretty amazing things as this hormone is an amazing plateau buster. As you understand hitting walls where gains stop is very common; even when steroids are used you will at some point hit this wall. This is where a solid Dianabol cycle can be game changing as it will help you bust through the wall with force if used during this period for that purpose.</p><h3>Sample Dianabol Cycle:</h3><p>When you plan your Dianabol cycle the most obvious question is how much do you need to take; after all, if you take too little what’s the point in taking it and you obviously don’t want to take too much and develop horrible problems. For the first time Dbol user there is no point in getting crazy; a moderate dose of 20mg-30mg per day will suffice and produce amazing results; in-fact, in many cases this will be all the Dianabol ever needed even for advanced athletes. Of course some will want more and generally speaking 50mg per day will be as high as anyone will ever need to go. Of course understand the higher the dose the greater risk of adverse side-effects and this will be something you need to keep an eye on. Now we’re not saying you cannot run more than 50mg per day, you’ll find there are quite a few people who do but in the name of safety this is not something we can advise. Regardless of how much you take most will find 6 weeks of total use to be just about perfect. Further, most will find extending use past 6 weeks to be pointless as gains will not be very strong past the 6 week mark of a Dianabol cycle.

While there are many possible side-effects in-which we can discuss, here we want to focus on Dianabol side-effects and Dianabol side-effects only but before we do there are several things we must consider and bring to the<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#35134438""> table<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a>. There are numerous forms of anabolic androgenic steroids and each one carries its own list of possible side-effects; while there are often strong similarities there are also unique factors to eachsteroid. Further, we cannot simply say “XYZ” steroid will cause such and such adverse reactions; possible side-effects mean just that, “possible” and by no means implies guaranteed. We must look at what the possible side-effects are, what the probability of such an effect occurring is, what we can do to prevent them and what we can do to reverse them should they occur. These are all important factors that are often left ignored in anabolic steroid discussion and that is irresponsible. We must also take into account individual response. As we are all unique human beings certain things will affect all of us differently. For example, you may be able to drink ten<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#43900797""> glasses<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> of milk a day but then another man, if he takes even a sip he becomes very ill. Different hormones, different medications and even different foods affect all of us a little differently; if you put it into your body there will be a reaction but if adverse reactions occur this will vary from person to person. With all of this in mind we want to take a look at the Methandrostenolone hormone commonly known as Dianabol or Dbol. When we look at the hormone we will find it is generally very well-tolerated among healthy adult men who supplement responsibly; while there are possible Dianabol side-effects the rate of probability appears to be very low in healthy adult men who supplement responsibly. Even so, you need to know what these effects may be and how to combat them and that is exactly what we want to discuss.</p><h3>Toxic Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Dianabol belongs to the C17-Alpha Alkylated (C17-aa) family of anabolic steroids thereby making it toxic to the liver. The reason for this<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#62460690""> nature<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> is simply by the manner in-which the hormone exist. The C17-aa nature is a structural change, simply put the hormone is structurally altered at the 17th carbon position in-order for it to survive the first pass of the liver after ingestion; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver and completely useless in every way. Unfortunately this change in the hormones structure will cause liver enzymes to increase during use due to this toxic nature. Before you freak out there are some things you may be interested in knowing. You may or may not understand but most anything you put into your body of an oral steroid or non-steroidal medication is toxic to the liver due to the manner in-which it exist. Further, while possessing a strong hepatic nature the Dianabol hormone is not nearly as toxic to the liver as many common over the counter medications and is nowhere near as toxic as daily alcohol consumption. However, due this nature we must limit our use of this steroid to short periods of use, normally 4-6 weeks of total use each time the hormone is used to ensure our liver remains healthy. Although your liver enzyme levels will increase with use, if you are responsible with dosing and total duration of use they will return to normal very shortly after use is discontinued.</p><h3>Common Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>The most common Dianabol side-effects are largely due to the aromatase effect; simply put, the Dianabol hormone aromatizes causing a buildup of estrogen in the body. Make no mistake, estrogen is a very<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#80680807""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> hormone we need for proper function but too much can be very problematic. While this remains true we will also find these Dianabol side-effects to be very avoidable with proper use and while aromatizing plays a major role, other factors also can come into play with some of these Dianabol side-effects. The most common Dianabol side-effects include:</p><ul><li>Gynecomastia</li><li>Excess Water Retention</li><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>High LDL Cholesterol</li><li>Low HDL Cholesterol</li></ul><p>- Gynecomastia &amp; Water Retention: to combat these Dianabol side-effects we have two options, SERM’s or AI’s with AI’s being far more effective. SERM’s such as Nolvadex act by binding to the receptors in the place of estrogen thereby preventing Gynecomastia, however, if you’re a little more sensitive all the SERM’s in the world will do very little for you; further, SERM’s will do very little regarding water retention. With AI’s such as Letrozole the aromatase process is inhibited and total estrogen is<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#76670794""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> reduced quite substantially. This not only protects against Gynecomastia and water retention but all of the common Dianabol side-effects to a degree. Of course it must be noted as it is often neglected in conversation; many who suffer from excess water retention blame it on the Dbol when in-fact the true culprit is their diet. If you’re eating too much, especially excess carbohydrates you’re going to bloat and if you’re supplementing with Dianabol you’re really going to bloat and hold water. In many cases if the individual simply cut his carb consumption down he’d save himself a lot of unwanted stress. - High Blood Pressure: The Dianabol steroid can be one of the harsher regarding blood pressure. If you already suffer from high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid; if you are sensitive to incurring high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid. Regardless of your condition you’re going to want to keep an eye on your blood pressure when this steroid is used. Many will not have the first problem; in-fact, many will be able to supplement with all they want without problems at all but others may see increases. Keeping estrogen under control can greatly benefit you as can simply living a healthy lifestyle that is blood pressure friendly. - Cholesterol: To combat these Dianabol side-effects the absolute best thing you can do is to live a cholesterol friendly lifestyle and this means eating properly. There are many foods that have been proven to be very cholesterol friendly such as foods in the Omega Fatty Acid family. Those who consume plenty of such foods and keep their estrogen levels under control will have a far better Dianabol experience.</p><h3>Guaranteed Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Of all the Dianabol side-effects there are two that are 100% guaranteed and that is testosterone suppression and testicular atrophy and the latter is dependent on the former. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed and when production is suppressed, as testosterone is manufactured in the testicles our testicles atrophy. For this reason it is<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#83660397""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> to supplement with testosterone when we supplement with Dianabol, as testosterone is not only a beneficial hormone but one that is also essential to our overall health. When we provide our body with the testosterone it needs we will not suffer from any of the low testosterone symptoms; however, as we are not making our own testosterone our testicles will still lose a little of their fullness. While this remains true once all steroid use has come to an end the body will begin making its own testosterone again and our testicles will return to their normal size.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>In the end, while Dianabol side-effects are real they are largely avoidable and controllable with responsible use and part of responsible use is proper dosing but perhaps of an even greater importance is simply the manner in-which you live. Living a healthy lifestyle will do more for you than anything else and if you can do this as well as supplement properly, assuming you’re a healthy adult male you will have in most all cases an enjoyable and positive experience. Of course it’s always<a class=""Q8U1D812k sA7l2mMcw"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/dianabol-methandienone/methandienone-tablets-our-product.html#17483140""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> to remember as we’re all very unique individuals even if you are a healthy adult male you may not respond to the hormone in as strong of a positive fashion as the man next to you; most will be fine and enjoy this steroids benefits but as with all things in life there are exceptions.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

<h3><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>
Bromazepam (marketed under several brand names, including Lectopam, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium and Lexotanil) is a benzodiazepine derivative drug, patented by Roche in 1963 and developed clinically in the 1970s.It has mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam (Valium). In addition to being used to treat anxiety or panic states, bromazepam may be used as a premedicant prior to minor surgery.Bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children. Prolonged use of bromazepam causes tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug. <strong>What is bromazepam used for?</strong> Bromazepam (also known as Lexotan®) is known as a benzodiazepine. It is mainly used to help treat the symptoms of anxiety. It can also be used to help the symptoms of panic and social anxiety. It is made as tablets. <strong>What is the usual dose of bromazepam?</strong> The usual dose of bromazepam in adults for anxiety is 3-18mg a day a day, usually split up throughout the day. In older people the dose should be a bit lower e.g. half the adult dose. <strong>How and when should I take bromazepam?</strong> Swallow the tablets with at least half a glass of water whilst sitting or standing. This is to make sure that it reaches the stomach and does not stick in your throat. There is no problem about taking bromazepam before, with, or after food. <strong>How long will it be before bromazepam works?</strong> Bromazepam usually starts to work in about an hour. The effect may then build over several days or weeks. <strong>How long will I need to keep taking bromazepam for?</strong> This will depend on what you are taking it for. <strong>Can I stop taking bromazepam suddenly?</strong> You could become dependent on bromazepam if you take it regularly every day for more than about 4 to 6 weeks, although this is not such a problem if you are taking it for epilepsy. If you have taken it regularly, it might be best to reduce the dose slowly over a few days or weeks. You should discussthis fully with your prescriber, doctor, nurse or pharmacist. If you are taking it “when required” every few days you should be able stop when you feel you don’t need it any more. <strong>What should I do if I forget to take a dose of bromazepam?</strong> Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is within about 4 hours of your next dose. If you remember after this just take the next dose as normal. Do not try to catch up by taking two doses at once as you may get more side-effects. <strong>Can I drink alcohol while I am taking bromazepam?</strong> If you drink alcohol while taking bromazepam it may make you feel more sleepy. This is particularly important if you need to drive or operate machinery and you must seek advice on this. <strong>What sort of side-effects might I get if I am taking bromazepam?</strong> Many people get: A few people get: A very few people get:  Dizziness  Sleepiness  Feeling unsteady on your feet the next day  Headache  Confusion  Amnesia (forgetting things) Do not be worried by this list of side effects. Some people get no side effects at all and others may get some effects that are not listed here. If you think you might have a side effect to your medicine, you should ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Can I drive or cycle while I am taking bromazepam? Bromazepam may affect your ability to drive, and it can cause a little dizziness and lightheadedness. Until you know how bromazepam affects you, be careful about driving or operating machinery. You should be careful as it may slow down your reaction times.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">1,5 mg / 1 tab. (28 tabs.)</span></pre>

<h1>Proviron</h1>
<h3>(Mesterolone)</h3>
Proviron is perhaps the most overrated item in the history of performance enhancement and at the same time underrated for it is largely misunderstood; in-fact, we can aptly label this one of the more unique anabolic steroids of all time and while many of its features are not necessarily “steroid like” it is just that, an anabolic steroid. Brought to the market by Schering, a premier manufacturer ofanabolic steroids and for many years, actually a couple of decade’s in-fact, it was praised for its testosterone increasing effects. However, in recent years the compound has largely fallen out of popularity but in some circles you will still see it pronounced as the anabolic of truth, the end all be all addition to a cycle; the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, there is a good purpose for this steroid but it is by no means a necessary steroid of choice but can be an OK addition to a cycle when used correctly and for the right purpose.
<h3>Proviron:</h3>
<strong>Proviron</strong> is the trade name given to the <strong>Mesterolone hormone</strong> by Schering; a Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derivative with strong similarities to many other DHT based anabolic steroids. Proviron’s direct mode of action is very similar to Stanozolol and in many circles the two are often compared but a more accurate description would be to compare Proviron to Masteron; Masteron is another DHT derived anabolic but when we look at Proviron we find some very similar qualities. Like Masteron Proviron will not aromatize and further actually aids in total aromatase prevention. As is by its nature as a DHT base Proviron is also very androgenic and by such trait as well as the traits mentioned you can begin to see the close relation to the highly popular Masteron steroid. Proviron is also an oral anabolic steroid but unlike most oral steroids Proviron is not very toxic to the liver; it is not a 17-Alpha-Alkylated (17-aa) steroid but rather a 1-metyhl addition that allows it to be useable. Most oral steroids carry the 17-aa alteration in order for them to survive ingestion and it is this structural change that leads them to be hepatic; although toxicity varies from one oral to the next as Proviron lacks the 17-aa structural change its toxicity is very low. While the lacking 17-aa change can be welcomed in many ways this may be the very reason this steroids total active effect is so mild; unfortunately there is lacking clarity in this regard. Of perhaps a more interesting aspect of the Mesterolone hormone, Proviron binds strongly to both the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) as well as the anabolic receptors and while this provides some highly welcomed benefits as we will shortly see it can also raise concern; Proviron is by far not one of the more side-effect friendly anabolic steroids. Nevertheless, the very traits seem to act in a positive manner that promotes lipolysis as well as allowing exogenous testosterone to become more active on a per milligram basis due to these binding factors. In the end, the synergy created by Proviron and testosterone is very strong and one of the strongest in-terms of efficiency we have in a two item stacked combo.
<h3>The Benefits of Proviron:</h3>
Proviron has some strong benefits as you can already see just from understanding its nature; however, it is a very poor steroid when it is used alone, as the benefits in-which it provides is largely dependent on the other <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> present. In short, while very simplistic the presence of Proviron makes the steroids you’re already taking more valuable than they are on their own and further makes them more efficient in-terms of the risk to reward ratio. Recall from above, like Masteron Proviron aids in the prevention of the aromatase that can occur in many other steroids, therefore by eliminating the aromatizing effect we decrease the probability such an effect can bring about in-terms of <strong>side-effects</strong>. Further and perhaps more important, by its binding nature the testosterone you use (exogenous forms) will be allowed to function more powerfully, more of it will be present and able to perform in anabolic capacity than if Proviron was absent. As these are some fantastic benefits the most pronounced benefit is perhaps the steroids total increasing of metabolic activity. As Proviron performs its duty directly on the androgen receptors this not only affects the muscle cells but fat cells within the body as well and in a very positive manner. Proviron binds to the androgen receptors strongly, very strongly and by such this allows for a greater<strong>fat burning</strong> nature within the body. No, we wouldn’t label Proviron as a cutting steroid necessarily nor would we label it a bulking steroid; Proviron is simply a steroid that promotes overall activity in every aspect for whatever reason you’re wanting to supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids.
<h3>The Side-Effects of Proviron:</h3>
It’s no secret, anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them a potential for negative side-effects and Proviron makes no exception. It is also important to remember the level of potential varies greatly with each and every anabolic steroid and potential always means, regardless of the level “possible” and by no means comes anywhere close to meaning guaranteed. In the case of Proviron it does not carry with it a high risk for adverse effects but as a DHT based anabolic steroid we cannot in this case label it an ultimately side-effect friendly steroid either. Proviron can have a negative effect regarding the hair-line as well as irritating the prostate by enlargement but it is impossible to predict if you will be affected negatively. In regarding hair-loss we can say with assurance, if Proviron causes any hair-loss or any steroid for that matter you were going to lose some hair anyway; Proviron simply sped the inevitable up; those who are not predisposed to male pattern baldness have nothing to fear. If you’ve read this far then you already know, Proviron will not cause <strong>water retention, Gynecomastiaor really any estrogenic related effect</strong>s. Recall, Proviron has a very positive effect on estrogen in-terms of actually binding aromatase and even reducing total accumulation to a degree. No, it will not reduce estrogen to the level of an aromatase inhibitor, not even remotely close but it will have a positive effect.
<h3>Proviron &amp; PCT:</h3>
For years many have argued that Proviron is a good choice for <strong>Post Cycle Therapy</strong> (PCT) purposes; we however strongly disagree. If anything Proviron could be a useful bridging anabolic steroid agent but for a full blown PCT purposes SERM’s and hCG will always prove to be best; even so, let’s look at the argument. Proviron can have a decently positive effect on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular-Axis (HPTA) by way of increasing both Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) the two hormones responsible for natural testosterone production; LH to an even larger degree than FSH. As levels of these two hormones increase so does natural testosterone production, for it is the FSH and LH that stimulate the testicles to produce testosterone; without FSH and LH release and the stimulating they cause no testosterone can be produced. However, while stimulating natural testosterone production during PCT is one of the primary roles it is not the only purpose; leading into normalization is the primary purpose of a PCT and as <em>Proviron</em> is a synthetic anabolic steroid this more or less defeats the purpose for a PCT that plans on being followed by a long anabolic steroid break. Even so, we must make an exception; for the individual who is only taking a short break and this is something we cannot advise, that is up to you, say a 6 week break, a dosing of Proviron during this period might prove to be useful.
<h3>Proviron Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3>
As this anabolic steroid is not very liver toxic, in-fact it is quite mild it can be used for extended periods of time; if you are not susceptible to DHT based side-effects you could reasonably supplement with Proviron the entire duration of your cycle. While it can be used for extended periods, as we will see dosing protocol can vary dramatically depending on the purpose for which it is used. If Proviron is being used simply as a quasi-anti-estrogen medication then a mere <strong>25mg per day</strong> may be all you need but many will find 50mg to be needed if their cycle contains a high dosing of aromatizing steroids. For those who are supplementing for additional beneficial purposes higher doses may be needed; although <strong>50mg</strong> will provide them solid effects a slightly higher bump may be needed. If you choose to use Proviron this is something you may need to play with as individual response will vary greatly. For the individual who supplements for the purpose of bridging, a rather common purpose of Proviron use, doses will necessarily be much higher, ranging from <strong>100mg-150mg per day</strong> if the individual is going to obtain the desired effect and benefits.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">25 mg/tab.

Tamoxifen Citrate was originally brought to the market place by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and introduced to the world as a suitable Morning After pill but in the end this would prove to be far from its positive purpose. Shortly after its inception is was discovered Nolvadex provided a formidable opponent against breast cancer but as is common soon performance purposes were found too. This is not an uncommon phenomenon, not by a long shot; many <strong>performance enhancing drugs</strong> start out as anything but performance enhancing drugs but so many in the end find this to be their primary purpose. However, unlike many anabolic steroids that have been found to fit this same bill Nolvadex does not actually enhance performance to a great degree but rather allows the individual to enhance more thoroughly as we will see; in-fact, Nolvadex has proven to be one of the more irreplaceable items in the arsenal of most performance enhancers.</p><h3>Nolvadex:</h3><p>Comprised of the active compound Tamoxifen Citrate but more well-known by its most common trade name Nolvadex and often referred to simply as Nolva Nolvadex belongs to a class of drugs known as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs.) In many ways this compound is very similar to another famous SERM Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid) with Nolva being more powerful on a milligram for milligram basis. <strong>Nolvadex</strong> exists as an antagonist of the estrogen receptors thereby preventing estrogen from binding and binding in its place. For this reason many often refer to this SERM as an anti-estrogen but this is a little off base. Nolvadex doesnt have the ability to reduce estrogen in the body nor does it have the ability to prevent it from forming and building up; for such an affect to occur one would need an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI.) AIs actively reduce estrogen in the body, most commonly Arimidex and Letrozole come to mind but they also aid in preventing the estrogen from existing in the first place and this is and can be very useful to most any anabolic steroid user. Nolvadex does not carry this nature with it; it merely blocks the estrogen from taking action to a degree; make no mistake, while not as powerful as an AI this trait can be very useful and it is hardly its only trait. Another thing to consider is the estrogen hormone itself, the very hormone it binds; sometimes reducing estrogen or limiting its existence really isnt a good thing; we actually need some estrogen in our system in order to be properly functioning human beings.<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#58626900""> Even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> so, when estrogen levels increase this can be a problem and this is when remedy must often take place.

When present in the body Nolvadex actively stimulates the release of Luteinizing Hormones (LH) a very important hormone, for it is its release <strong>that stimulates natural testosterone production</strong>. Without LH (among other things) there is no testosterone production in the body and as anabolicsteroids greatly suppress our natural testosterone production, again, this is where Nolvadex can prove to be very useful; in-fact, it is in this regard where we may find it to be the most useful of all.</p><h3>The Benefits of Nolvadex:</h3><p>As Nolvadex by<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#12198732""> nature<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> performs two very specific actions it will have two very specific uses for the anabolic steroid user and each comes at a different time and serves its own unique purpose. No, the hormone does not change when we use it for one purpose rather than the other, regardless of use its very nature remains unchanged but it is the purpose of use that may vary and we will find the purpose of use to be while on cycle or during the Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan.

As eluded to before anabolic androgenic steroids suppress natural testosterone production; regardless of the steroids used this will occur. It is true; some steroids will suppress more than others and while dosing and duration will play a large role suppression to some degree will exist. Once a cycle of anabolic steroids has come to an end the first order of business is to ensure natural testosterone production begins again and as fast as possible; even if your cycle included exogenous testosterone (which we highly recommend) your natural levels will still be suppressed and far from optimal. Restarting production is<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#75809941""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> largely for two reasons; what should be the most obvious is normalizing returning the body to its natural function in order to maintain proper health. Further, the faster we can restart natural production; thereby ensuring adequate testosterone is in our body the more gains we will hold onto that we earned through the cycle. It is very important to note while Nolvadex therapy is very useful for this purpose a simple PCT plan that includes the SERM will not by itself bring natural levels back to normal. Yes, it will greatly speed up the process but a standard 3-4 week PCT plan is not going to have you where you were before your cycle began. As PCT purposes are perhaps its greatest trait it is another purpose that first made the SERM quite popular among performance enhancers and this was as an on cycle side-effect preventer and most notably as a Gynecomastia fighting agent. They do not all possess this trait but many anabolic steroids convert to estrogen via the aromatase process and as estrogen increases so can its negative effects; there is truly a fine line when it comes to the total amount of estrogen you want and can tolerate. As estrogen levels increase Gynecomastia can become very problematic but if the estrogen cannot bind to the receptors as Nolvadex will prevent, the<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#29451431""> odds<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> of incurring Gyno as it is commonly known greatly reduce. While a very powerful Gyno preventer, for some Nolva will not be enough and many will find they need to actively reduce estrogen and inhibit it from forming in the first place; for this individual only an AI will do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Nolvadex:</h3><p>Without question Nolvadex is one of the milder and most highly well-tolerated items any performance enhancer will ever use with its greatest adverse side-effect being its absence. Nevertheless, as discussed some estrogen is needed in the body and thankfully Nolvadex wont bring your levels down for if nothing else estrogen is essential to a functioning immune system among many other things. However, some have speculated that by its binding ability it may prohibit estrogen from doing its job to too much of a degree; however, this appears to be mere speculation by those of an anti-performance enhancing nature as there is no proof that this problem could ever exist. There have also been issues of metabolic function that have arose in the past but again, the evidence to support such claims is found very lacking and it is very rarely an issue brought up in the first place. There is also a possible side-effect regarding on<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#87376168""> cycle<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> use that is linked to growth and many <strong>anabolic steroid</strong>users report their growth is somewhat diminished when Nolva is present. It is true, as estrogen is important to the growth or the gaining process this could be a problem when certain items are used but as Nolva doesnt actually reduce estrogen and presents very little action in this regard that would lend to such a problem as we are confirmed in our thinking that is largely in ones head; the evidence simply isnt there.</p><h3>Nolvadex and Clomid:</h3><p>In the world of performance enhancing there are very few items as similar as Nolvadex and Clomid and both can serve a PCT plan equally as well but in many circles this is often argued but it is an argument often lacking in weight. It is true, on a per milligram basis Nolvadex is far more powerful than Clomid and automatically most will assume Nolvadex is the better SERM. However, all things considered equal, if an individual used Clomid for his PCT and another used Nolvadex adjusting the doses to match up in milligram potency, again, all things equal the results would be fairly close to the same. Some studies have shown however that recovery might be a little faster with the Nolvadex SERM but it is not to a massively large degree and in the end either is fine. However, most will not use enough Clomid to match the power of Nolva for to match 40mg of Nolvadex you will need approximately 150mg of Clomiphene Citrate but the good news is both are cheap, almost never faked and in the end either will do.</p><h3>Nolvadex Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Depending on the period of use will determine how we<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#26005722""> cycle<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> and dose our <strong>Nolvadex</strong> to a very large degree. For the performance enhancer while on cycle generally <strong>10mg per day</strong> the entire duration is well-suited for the prevention of Gynecomastia but some may need a little more. However, if you need more than <strong>10mg per day</strong> theres a good chance youre going to need something stronger than Nolva to begin with and in this case an AI is going to be in your future. While total cycle use may sound concerning to some recall from our side-effects discussion; adverse effects are not of a great concern here and extended use is very well-tolerated. For PCT use, Nolvas absolute best period of use, the total dosing will be much higher than on cycle use and the duration of use rather short lived. In most cases the dosing will start at 40mg per day for almost any individual regardless of the extent of his cycle and in most cases two total weeks of this dosing is advised. After the first two weeks have passed a good two weeks at <strong>20mg per day</strong> will generally be warranted and for many this will be the end of their PCT. For many this will be all the therapy they need and if you feel you need a little more time another week or two of low dose Nolva may not be too bad of an idea; it is one of those things you may have to play around with a little bit over the course of a few cycles to find what works best for you. Further, for ultimate PCT help you will find Nolvadex works very well with hCG; in-fact, in almost any PCT plan we highly recommend hCG with Nolva use, beginning and completing hCG use right before Nolvadex therapy begins. Not all cycles will require a PCT such as this; mild cycles and newbie cycles may be fine without it but<a class=""E1M68tdWi3 Yw6Y6oBuS"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/antiestrogens-and-pct/tamoxifen-citrate-tablets-our-product.html#87631386""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> in a mild cycle such precaution will not hurt and will greatly aid you in the end.</p>","<pre><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

Brought to the market by Schering, a premier manufacturer ofanabolic steroids and for many years, actually a couple of decade’s in-fact, it was praised for its testosterone increasing effects. However, in recent years the compound has largely fallen out of popularity but in some circles you will still see it pronounced as the anabolic of truth, the end all be all addition to a cycle; the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, there is a good purpose for this steroid but it is by no means a necessary steroid of choice but can be an OK addition to a cycle when used correctly and for the right purpose.</p><h3>Proviron:</h3><p><strong>Proviron</strong> is the trade name given to the <strong>Mesterolone hormone</strong> by Schering; a Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derivative with strong similarities to many other DHT based anabolic steroids. Proviron’s direct mode of action is very similar to Stanozolol and in many circles the two are often compared but a more accurate description would be to compare Proviron to Masteron; Masteron is another DHT derived anabolic but when we look at Proviron we find some very similar qualities. Like Masteron Proviron will not aromatize and further actually aids in total aromatase prevention. As is by its nature as a DHT base Proviron is also very androgenic and by such trait as well as the traits mentioned you can begin to see the close relation to the highly popular Masteron steroid. Proviron is also an oral anabolic steroid but unlike most oral steroids Proviron is not very toxic to the liver; it is not a 17-Alpha-Alkylated (17-aa) steroid but rather a 1-metyhl addition that allows it to be useable. Most oral steroids carry the 17-aa alteration in order for them to survive ingestion and it is this structural change that leads them to be hepatic; although toxicity varies from one oral to the next as Proviron lacks the 17-aa structural change its toxicity is very low. While the lacking 17-aa change can be welcomed in many ways this may be the very reason this steroids total active effect is so mild; unfortunately there is lacking clarity in this regard. Of perhaps a more interesting aspect of the Mesterolone hormone, Proviron binds strongly to both the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) as well as the anabolic receptors and while this provides some highly welcomed benefits as we will shortly see it can also raise concern; Proviron is by far not one of the more side-effect friendly anabolic steroids. Nevertheless, the very traits seem to act in a positive manner that promotes lipolysis as well as allowing exogenous testosterone to become more active on a per milligram basis due to these binding factors. In the end, the synergy created by Proviron and testosterone is very strong and one of the strongest in-terms of efficiency we have in a two item stacked combo.</p><h3>The Benefits of Proviron:</h3><p>Proviron has some strong benefits as you can already see just from understanding its nature; however, it is a very poor steroid when it is used alone, as the benefits in-which it provides is largely dependent on the other <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> present. In short, while very simplistic the presence of Proviron makes the steroids you’re already taking more valuable than they are on their own and further makes them more efficient in-terms of the risk to reward ratio. Recall from above, like Masteron Proviron aids in the prevention of the aromatase that can occur in many other steroids, therefore by eliminating the aromatizing effect we decrease the probability such an effect can bring about in-terms of <strong>side-effects</strong>. Further and perhaps more important, by its binding nature the testosterone you use (exogenous forms) will be allowed to function more powerfully, more of it will be present and able to perform in anabolic capacity than if Proviron was absent. As these are some fantastic benefits the most pronounced benefit is perhaps the steroids total increasing of metabolic activity. As Proviron performs its duty directly on the androgen receptors this not only affects the muscle cells but fat cells within the body as well and in a very positive manner. Proviron binds to the androgen receptors strongly, very strongly and by such this allows for a greater<strong>fat burning</strong> nature within the body. No, we wouldn’t label Proviron as a cutting steroid necessarily nor would we label it a bulking steroid; Proviron is simply a steroid that promotes overall activity in every aspect for whatever reason you’re wanting to supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Proviron:</h3><p>It’s no secret, anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them a potential for negative side-effects and Proviron makes no exception. It is also important to remember the level of potential varies greatly with each and every anabolic steroid and potential always means, regardless of the level “possible” and by no means comes anywhere close to meaning guaranteed. In the case of Proviron it does not carry with it a high risk for adverse effects but as a DHT based anabolic steroid we cannot in this case label it an ultimately side-effect friendly steroid either. Proviron can have a negative effect regarding the hair-line as well as irritating the prostate by enlargement but it is impossible to predict if you will be affected negatively. In regarding hair-loss we can say with assurance, if Proviron causes any hair-loss or any steroid for that matter you were going to lose some hair anyway; Proviron simply sped the inevitable up; those who are not predisposed to male pattern baldness have nothing to fear. If you’ve read this far then you already know, Proviron will not cause <strong>water retention, Gynecomastiaor really any estrogenic related effect</strong>s. Recall, Proviron has a very positive effect on estrogen in-terms of actually binding aromatase and even reducing total accumulation to a degree. No, it will not reduce estrogen to the level of an aromatase inhibitor, not even remotely close but it will have a positive effect.</p><h3>Proviron &amp; PCT:</h3><p>For years many have argued that Proviron is a good choice for <strong>Post Cycle Therapy</strong> (PCT) purposes; we however strongly disagree. If anything Proviron could be a useful bridging anabolic steroid agent but for a full blown PCT purposes SERM’s and hCG will always prove to be best; even so, let’s look at the argument. Proviron can have a decently positive effect on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular-Axis (HPTA) by way of increasing both Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) the two hormones responsible for natural testosterone production; LH to an even larger degree than FSH. As levels of these two hormones increase so does natural testosterone production, for it is the FSH and LH that stimulate the testicles to produce testosterone; without FSH and LH release and the stimulating they cause no testosterone can be produced. However, while stimulating natural testosterone production during PCT is one of the primary roles it is not the only purpose; leading into normalization is the primary purpose of a PCT and as <em>Proviron</em> is a synthetic anabolic steroid this more or less defeats the purpose for a PCT that plans on being followed by a long anabolic steroid break. Even so, we must make an exception; for the individual who is only taking a short break and this is something we cannot advise, that is up to you, say a 6 week break, a dosing of Proviron during this period might prove to be useful.</p><h3>Proviron Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>As this anabolic steroid is not very liver toxic, in-fact it is quite mild it can be used for extended periods of time; if you are not susceptible to DHT based side-effects you could reasonably supplement with Proviron the entire duration of your cycle. While it can be used for extended periods, as we will see dosing protocol can vary dramatically depending on the purpose for which it is used. If Proviron is being used simply as a quasi-anti-estrogen medication then a mere <strong>25mg per day</strong> may be all you need but many will find 50mg to be needed if their cycle contains a high dosing of aromatizing steroids. For those who are supplementing for additional beneficial purposes higher doses may be needed; although <strong>50mg</strong> will provide them solid effects a slightly higher bump may be needed. If you choose to use Proviron this is something you may need to play with as individual response will vary greatly. For the individual who supplements for the purpose of bridging, a rather common purpose of Proviron use, doses will necessarily be much higher, ranging from <strong>100mg-150mg per day</strong> if the individual is going to obtain the desired effect and benefits.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">25 mg/tab.

Tamoxifen Citrate was originally brought to the market place by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and introduced to the world as a suitable Morning After pill but in the end this would prove to be far from its positive purpose. Shortly after its inception is was discovered Nolvadex provided a formidable opponent against breast cancer but as is common soon performance purposes were found too. This is not an uncommon phenomenon, not by a long shot; many <strong>performance enhancing drugs</strong> start out as anything but performance enhancing drugs but so many in the end find this to be their primary purpose. However, unlike many anabolic steroids that have been found to fit this same bill Nolvadex does not actually enhance performance to a great degree but rather allows the individual to enhance more thoroughly as we will see; in-fact, Nolvadex has proven to be one of the more irreplaceable items in the arsenal of most performance enhancers.</p><h3>Nolvadex:</h3><p>Comprised of the active compound Tamoxifen Citrate but more well-known by its most common trade name Nolvadex and often referred to simply as Nolva Nolvadex belongs to a class of drugs known as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs.) In many ways this compound is very similar to another famous SERM Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid) with Nolva being more powerful on a milligram for milligram basis. <strong>Nolvadex</strong> exists as an antagonist of the estrogen receptors thereby preventing estrogen from binding and binding in its place. For this reason many often refer to this SERM as an anti-estrogen but this is a little off base. Nolvadex doesnt have the ability to reduce estrogen in the body nor does it have the ability to prevent it from forming and building up; for such an affect to occur one would need an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI.) AIs actively reduce estrogen in the body, most commonly Arimidex and Letrozole come to mind but they also aid in preventing the estrogen from existing in the first place and this is and can be very useful to most any anabolic steroid user. Nolvadex does not carry this nature with it; it merely blocks the estrogen from taking action to a degree; make no mistake, while not as powerful as an AI this trait can be very useful and it is hardly its only trait. Another thing to consider is the estrogen hormone itself, the very hormone it binds; sometimes reducing estrogen or limiting its existence really isnt a good thing; we actually need some estrogen in our system in order to be properly functioning human beings. Even so, when estrogen levels increase this can be a problem and this is when remedy must often take place. As estrogen binding is an important trait in-which this <strong>SERM possesses</strong> it is not the most important one, as Nolva has been proven to have a strong positive effect on natural testosterone production. When present in the body Nolvadex actively stimulates the release of Luteinizing Hormones (LH) a very important hormone, for it is its release <strong>that stimulates natural testosterone production</strong>. Without LH (among other things) there is no testosterone production in the body and as anabolicsteroids greatly suppress our natural testosterone production, again, this is where Nolvadex can prove to be very useful; in-fact, it is in this regard where we may find it to be the most useful of all.</p><h3>The Benefits of Nolvadex:</h3><p>As Nolvadex by nature performs two very specific actions it will have two very specific uses for the anabolic steroid user and each comes at a different time and serves its own unique purpose. No, the hormone does not change when we use it for one purpose rather than the other, regardless of use its very nature remains unchanged but it is the purpose of use that may vary and we will find the purpose of use to be while on cycle or during the Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan. For most anabolic steroid users Nolvadex will be part of a PCT supplemental plan and it is here that the SERM will serve its greatest purpose; so great we may aptly label Nolvadex as the single most important PCT medication of all time. As eluded to before anabolic androgenic steroids suppress natural testosterone production; regardless of the steroids used this will occur. It is true; some steroids will suppress more than others and while dosing and duration will play a large role suppression to some degree will exist. Once a cycle of anabolic steroids has come to an end the first order of business is to ensure natural testosterone production begins again and as fast as possible; even if your cycle included exogenous testosterone (which we highly recommend) your natural levels will still be suppressed and far from optimal. Restarting production is important largely for two reasons; what should be the most obvious is normalizing returning the body to its natural function in order to maintain proper health. Further, the faster we can restart natural production; thereby ensuring adequate testosterone is in our body the more gains we will hold onto that we earned through the cycle. It is very important to note while Nolvadex therapy is very useful for this purpose a simple PCT plan that includes the SERM will not by itself bring natural levels back to normal. Yes, it will greatly speed up the process but a standard 3-4 week PCT plan is not going to have you where you were before your cycle began. As PCT purposes are perhaps its greatest trait it is another purpose that first made the SERM quite popular among performance enhancers and this was as an on cycle side-effect preventer and most notably as a Gynecomastia fighting agent. They do not all possess this trait but many anabolic steroids convert to estrogen via the aromatase process and as estrogen increases so can its negative effects; there is truly a fine line when it comes to the total amount of estrogen you want and can tolerate. As estrogen levels increase Gynecomastia can become very problematic but if the estrogen cannot bind to the receptors as Nolvadex will prevent, the odds of incurring Gyno as it is commonly known greatly reduce. While a very powerful Gyno preventer, for some Nolva will not be enough and many will find they need to actively reduce estrogen and inhibit it from forming in the first place; for this individual only an AI will do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Nolvadex:</h3><p>Without question Nolvadex is one of the milder and most highly well-tolerated items any performance enhancer will ever use with its greatest adverse side-effect being its absence. Nevertheless, as discussed some estrogen is needed in the body and thankfully Nolvadex wont bring your levels down for if nothing else estrogen is essential to a functioning immune system among many other things. However, some have speculated that by its binding ability it may prohibit estrogen from doing its job to too much of a degree; however, this appears to be mere speculation by those of an anti-performance enhancing nature as there is no proof that this problem could ever exist. There have also been issues of metabolic function that have arose in the past but again, the evidence to support such claims is found very lacking and it is very rarely an issue brought up in the first place. There is also a possible side-effect regarding on cycle use that is linked to growth and many <strong>anabolic steroid</strong>users report their growth is somewhat diminished when Nolva is present. It is true, as estrogen is important to the growth or the gaining process this could be a problem when certain items are used but as Nolva doesnt actually reduce estrogen and presents very little action in this regard that would lend to such a problem as we are confirmed in our thinking that is largely in ones head; the evidence simply isnt there.</p><h3>Nolvadex and Clomid:</h3><p>In the world of performance enhancing there are very few items as similar as Nolvadex and Clomid and both can serve a PCT plan equally as well but in many circles this is often argued but it is an argument often lacking in weight. It is true, on a per milligram basis Nolvadex is far more powerful than Clomid and automatically most will assume Nolvadex is the better SERM. However, all things considered equal, if an individual used Clomid for his PCT and another used Nolvadex adjusting the doses to match up in milligram potency, again, all things equal the results would be fairly close to the same. Some studies have shown however that recovery might be a little faster with the Nolvadex SERM but it is not to a massively large degree and in the end either is fine. However, most will not use enough Clomid to match the power of Nolva for to match 40mg of Nolvadex you will need approximately 150mg of Clomiphene Citrate but the good news is both are cheap, almost never faked and in the end either will do.</p><h3>Nolvadex Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Depending on the period of use will determine how we cycle and dose our <strong>Nolvadex</strong> to a very large degree. For the performance enhancer while on cycle generally <strong>10mg per day</strong> the entire duration is well-suited for the prevention of Gynecomastia but some may need a little more. However, if you need more than <strong>10mg per day</strong> theres a good chance youre going to need something stronger than Nolva to begin with and in this case an AI is going to be in your future. While total cycle use may sound concerning to some recall from our side-effects discussion; adverse effects are not of a great concern here and extended use is very well-tolerated. For PCT use, Nolvas absolute best period of use, the total dosing will be much higher than on cycle use and the duration of use rather short lived. In most cases the dosing will start at 40mg per day for almost any individual regardless of the extent of his cycle and in most cases two total weeks of this dosing is advised. After the first two weeks have passed a good two weeks at <strong>20mg per day</strong> will generally be warranted and for many this will be the end of their PCT. For many this will be all the therapy they need and if you feel you need a little more time another week or two of low dose Nolva may not be too bad of an idea; it is one of those things you may have to play around with a little bit over the course of a few cycles to find what works best for you. Further, for ultimate PCT help you will find Nolvadex works very well with hCG; in-fact, in almost any PCT plan we highly recommend hCG with Nolva use, beginning and completing hCG use right before Nolvadex therapy begins. Not all cycles will require a PCT such as this; mild cycles and newbie cycles may be fine without it but even in a mild cycle such precaution will not hurt and will greatly aid you in the end.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

However, while ovarian stimulation was its primary design, by its very nature it stimulates all gonadotropins within the body and several other uses have been found for this non-steroidal medication, particularly in the world of performance enhancement. That is correct, <strong>Clomid</strong>as it is most commonly known is not a steroid, as it belongs to a class known as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) and like most all SERMs serves a vital purpose in hormonal production. As we will see, while ovarian stimulation and performance enhancement are perhaps its most common reason for use many men supplement with Clomid for the purpose of treating low testosterone, similar to the supplementation of aromatase inhibitors to meet this end.</p><h3>Clomid:</h3><p>A Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator, Clomid by design binds to the receptors thereby preventing estrogen from binding; in simplistic terms it takes estrogens place at this binding point and this can serve and bring about several benefits to the intended individual. While binding to the receptors Clomid also simultaneously increases the release of both Luteinizing and Follicle Stimulating Hormones (LH &amp; FSH) by way of stimulation; as both LH and FSH are imperative to testosterone production, without testosterone declines, through this direct stimulation natural testosterone production is increased. For the performance enhancer this presents two distinct benefits, one for On-Cycle protection by the receptor binding and one for Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) in-terms of re-stimulating proper natural hormonal production. For the treatment of <strong>low testosterone</strong>we can also easily begin to see the purpose, as increased LH and FSH lend to the desired end. We must here give distinction to clear up common confusion. It is often believed by many that Clomid actively reduces the amount of estrogen within the body or that it actively blocks it from existing in the first place; for this reason many refer to it as an anti-estrogen but this is somewhat inappropriate. Clomid does not inhibit estrogen production nor does it reduce the amount of estrogen in the body. Yes, there are medications that have this affect, most notably aromatase inhibitors, the most common being Arimidex and Letrozole. However, while Clomid does carry with it some similarities, especially revolving around HPTA its direct nature is unique in comparison to aromatase inhibitors.</p><h3>The Benefits of Clomid:</h3><p>For the anabolic androgenic steroid user there are three distinct benefits separated into two distinct categories; therapeutic testosterone replacement and performance enhancement. As we are aware many anabolic steroids convert into estrogen once present in the human body and never is this truer than with the advent and presence of exogenous testosterone. The cause of this estrogen conversion is largely brought on by what is commonly referred to as the aromatase process and it is this process that can lead to many of the most commonly known steroidal side-effects. Estrogen buildup is largely responsible for the brunt of anabolic steroid related side-effects and perhaps the most threatening for many is Gynecomastia or what is commonly known as Gyno or male breast enlargement. It is true, Clomid will do very little to reduce the total amount of estrogen in the body, in-fact it really wont do anything at all but it can prevent the existing estrogen from binding to the receptors of the pectoral region thereby preventing the onset of Gynecomastia. It is important to note, while this binding at the receptors can be very efficient it is limited in action; those who are extremely sensitive or who have a greater buildup of estrogen than <strong>Clomid</strong> can bind will find this SERM to be useless in-terms of side-effect prevention. For this individual only an active aromatase inhibitor will do; in the case of this individual we need a medication that not only inhibits estrogen from existing by conversion but one that actively reduces the total amount as well; this is where Arimidex and Letrozole really become invaluable. While Clomid has a use for On-Cycle steroid use it is perhaps during PCT that it really shines through and it is here most in the performance enhancing world will find it most beneficial and understanding this is relatively simple. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed; the degree varies depending on the steroids used and dosing and duration can also have an effect but regardless suppression will exist. Because natural testosterone suppression exists most will supplement with the testosterone steroid while on cycle; it is important to note, even the testosterone steroid actively suppresses natural testosterone production. As natural production is suppressed, while on cycle if exogenous testosterone is being used this is of very little concern; after all, with exogenous testosterone use we ensure we have the testosterone we need in our body and yes, you need testosterone as it is a hormone of absolute vital importance. Once the cycle is complete this is where some find they run into trouble; it is very common for gains from a cycle to be lost to the wind and for an individual to put on a little fat and just feel like a pile of garbage. Why does this happen, its simple, theyre not producing any or enough testosterone and no longer have any exogenous testosterone to meet this end. Through the use of Clomid, recall, it actively stimulates the release of natural testosterone we can see this problem remedied as it becomes a concern of distant memory past. It is commonly understood, testosterone is produced in the testicles of men but many fail to understand this is not where production begins; yes, you need well-functioning testicles but in many ways this is the end of the testosterone assembly line. To produce testosterone in adequate amounts we may aptly say production begins at the pituitary; the pituitary must release LH and it must release an adequate amount; the amount of LH released greatly determines the amount of testosterone produced. Again, recall from above, Clomid greatly stimulates LH release, thereby stimulating total testosterone production and aiding in ensuring enough testosterone is in the body. For years, in-fact decades performance enhancers have supplemented with Clomid for PCT purposes in order to preserve gains made but while this is important it proves to be even more important in-terms of preserving overall health; remember, testosterone is essential, so essential we can aptly label it one of the most important hormones the human body will ever produce. As Clomid so greatly stimulates natural testosterone production the benefit for the low testosterone patient is very easy to see; if you suffer from low testosterone you simply need to produce more and<em>Clomid</em> can provide a means by which your naturally produced levels can increase. For many men this is a welcomed medication to fill this role; simply take a pill once or twice a day and be done with it, problem solved but more times than not its simply not that simple. While Clomid can be beneficial and effective in low testosterone treatment more times than not it is not strong enough and directtestosterone therapy is needed; meaning, some sort of exogenous testosterone must be applied.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Clomid:</h3><p>Anabolic steroids, SERMs, NSAID painkillers such as Aspirin, they all carry with them possible side-effects, some more so than others and individual sensitivity always plays a large, very large role; while simplistic it is no different than how some are lactose intolerant while others are not. Remember, possible side-effects simply mean maybe it can happen and in no way means it will. As it pertains to Clomid we have a relatively side-effect friendly medication in-fact most will experience no<strong>side-effects</strong> at all but of those that do the most common is blurred vision. No, blurred vision does not mean blind, it simply means blurred and it will return to normal once use is discontinued. Some individuals have also reported abdominal discomfort and even hot flashes but both are extremely rare, so rare less than 1% of all Clomid users will ever experience them to any degree. Some Clomid users have also reported acne, especially on their back or shoulders but this is largely due to the increase of the now higher natural testosterone production and generally clears very fast as the body adapts and becomes accustomed.</p><h3>Clomid and Nolvadex:</h3><p>It is very common for both Clomid and Nolvadex (Tamoxifen Citrate) to be interchanged in conversation and this is not the worst comparison ever made as they are both very similar to one another in action as it pertains to those who supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids for any reason. However, while very similar in nature we cannot and should not interchange them identically as there are differences, most notably in-terms of potency. Both Clomid and Nolvadex belong to the SERM classification and both SERMs actively protect against estrogenic related side-effects and carry with them the ability to stimulate natural testosterone production. While the mode of action is very similar we find that on a milligram for milligram basis <strong><em>Nolvadex</em></strong> is much stronger than Clomid; for example to equal the power of 40mg of Nolvadex the individual would need close to 200mg of Clomid. In the end the individual will simply choose the one that works best for them but you need to be aware of the potency differences if you are to make the best use of either item. Many individuals fail to benefit from <strong>Clomid</strong> simply because they dont use enough, they often supplement with Clomid identically to the way they would Nolvadex and this is as you can see a mistake.</p><h3>Clomid Cycles and Doses:</h3><p>As Clomid side-effects are very rare and extremely mild if they occur at all, Clomid can be used for far extended periods of time if necessary; one could safely and effectively supplement with Clomid the entire duration of a cycle to prevent Gynecomastia if proven necessary. While Nolvadex is far more common to meet this end a simply dosing of 25mg of Clomid every day can in many cases be sufficient to prevent certain aromatase related side-effects while on cycle. However, many in the performance enhancing world will find this to be lacking as their doses of <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> will necessarily be high and stronger aromatase inhibitors will be needed. Without question it is during the PCT period most will find Clomid to be the most beneficial and without question the most common time period in-which this SERM will be used. The majority of performance enhancers will find a 4 week total PCT period to be very efficient with 3 weeks of the total period consisting of Clomid. For example, a solid PCT schedule might include a <strong>10-12 day</strong>period of hCG use followed by 3 weeks of Clomid therapy. Generally, a dosing of 150mg every day for one week followed by 2 weeks at 100mg can be very effective but depending on the individual some will need more time and another week or two at 50-100mg per day should suffice in this instance.</p><h3>The Effects of Clomid on PCT:</h3><p>During the PCT period the basic idea is twofold; to stimulate natural testosterone production and normalize the body. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed. For this reason most performance enhancers supplement with exogenous testosterone in-order to provide the body what it needs; not to mention testosterone is one of the most versatile anabolic steroids to begin with of enormous power. Once an anabolic steroid cycle is complete the first order of business is to bring natural testosterone production back online. No, a PCT plan will not do this all on its own, it will actually take several months to achieve this end but a solid PCT plan will provide this much faster than without. This is where the effects of Clomid can be very useful. One of the primary effects of Clomid is by the way it stimulates the release of Luteinizing and Follicle Stimulating Hormones (LH &amp; FSH) with a strong emphasis on LH. Both LH and FSH are essential to testosterone production; again, LH to an even larger degree. Without the release of LH no testosterone will be produced; by the effects of Clomid more LH is released thereby signaling to the testicles to produce more testosterone. As our testosterone levels increase by-way of this stimulated release of LH and FSH we are able to preserve more of the gains we made while on cycle but more importantly protect our health. Testosterone is an essential hormone necessary to a healthy and well-functioning body; in-fact, the testosterone hormone is one of the most important hormones our body produces. If our body does not have access to an adequate amount of this potent androgen we lose muscle mass, gain body-fat, lose strength and we also suffer greatly regarding mental function, sexual function and in general our entire disposition and quality of life goes into decline. For the PCT purpose its not hard to see why the effects of Clomid are so highly desired by many performance enhancers.</p><h3>Comparing Nolvadex:</h3><p>Clomid is not the only SERM used during PCT; the powerful and potent SERM Tamoxifen Citrate(Nolvadex) may be even more popular. The reason Nolvadex is perhaps more popular is because its often more readily available but largely its more popular in many circles due to myth. The belief is that Nolvadex is more powerfully effective than Clomid; the truth, Clomid and Nolvadex are almost identical. The effects of Clomid and Nolvadex during PCT use are the same; both stimulate the production of natural testosterone by the same mode of action; in that there is no difference. The reason this myth exists regarding Nolva as it is commonly known is because on a milligram for milligram basis Nolva is stronger than Clomid. When many performance enhancers supplement with Nolva, if they supplement with Clomid the next time theyll use a similar dose as they did with Nolva and even if they increase the dose its rarely enough. Doses of Nolva at 40mg per day are very common place during PCT use and many match their Clomid at a dose of 50mg per day and this is the problem. For the effects of Clomid to match 40mg of Nolvadex one will need about 150mg of Clomid. This does not make Clomiphene Citrate inferior to Tamoxifen Citrate any more than it makes Tylenol inferior to Extra-Strength Tylenol; we must simply recognize proper doses.</p><h3>Clomid vs. AIs:</h3><p>AIs or Aromatase Inhibitors are also often used during the PCT process and for stimulating natural testosterone production they may indeed beat the effects of Clomid; however, AI PCT use is not something we can recommend. AIs although excellent testosterone producing tools also greatly reduce estrogen and herein lies the problem. Estrogen is another very important hormone and during the PCT process we do not only want to stimulate testosterone production but we are wanting to normalize; we want all of our hormonal productions to be exactly what theyre supposed to be. The effects of Clomid will not decrease the estrogen levels of the body and this simply makes Clomiphene a better choice. Make no mistake, AIs are very useful to the performance enhancer while on-cycle as a means of protecting against many adverse side-effects but are best used for this purpose and not the PCT period.</p><h3>Clomid Cycle Timing:</h3><p>The basic Clomid cycle will as stated be used during PCT; in-fact, in many cases the entire PCT plan will comprise of this and only this SERM. When we start this cycle will be dependent on one single factor; how the anabolic steroid cycle ended. If our anabolic steroid cycle ends with any large ester base steroids in play our Clomid therapy will begin 2-3 weeks after out last steroid injection. Conversely, if our anabolic steroid cycle ends with all small ester base steroids our Clomid therapy will begin approximately 3 days after our last steroid injection. This time frame protocol is very important to follow. If you start your Clomid cycle too soon and your anabolic steroid cycle ended with large ester steroids youll be beating your head against the wall. Large esters take time to clear the body and theres no point in trying to stimulate natural testosterone production when suppressing agents are still present in the body. The same way of thinking must be applied to small ester base steroids as well. If we wait too long to start our Clomid cycle were only damaging our cause; theres a good chance well lose a lot more of the progress made when we wait too long. Understand the truth; the best PCT plan in the world will not preserve all the gains you made while on a cycle of anabolic steroids but we can do things to improve how much we keep and a quality Clomid cycle coupled with proper diet and training can do wonders.</p><h3>The Actual Clomid Cycle:</h3><p>The actual Clomid cycle itself will normally last 4-5 weeks with some men increasing the total duration to 6 weeks. Most men will find a starting dose of 150mg per day and ending with 50mg per day to be more than sufficient. Some men may not need this many weeks; some may be fine with 3 weeks but 4-5 weeks is a good rule of thumb and will ensure your PCT plan is all it can be. A sample Clomid cycle most all will find useful is as follows:</p><ul><li>Week 1: 150mg Every Day</li><li>Week 2: 150mg Every Day</li><li>Week 3: 100mg Every Day</li><li>Week 4: 100mg Every Day</li><li>Week 5: 50mg Every Day</li><li>Week 6: (Optional) 50mg Every Day</li></ul><h3>Enhancing Your Clomid Cycle:</h3><p>The best way to enhance your Clomid cycle is by adding Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) a powerful peptide hormone that greatly stimulates natural testosterone production. If this is added into the equation you will begin hCG use before your Clomid therapy begins. Most men will find 10 days of hCG therapy to be more than sufficient and lend to a more well-rounded PCT recovery plan. For most men a dosing of hCG at 500iu-1,000iu every day for 10 straight days will be the way to go; how much you choose precisely will be determined by individual need. Once your hCG therapy is complete transition into your Clomid therapy immediately. Further, in regards to timing; if your anabolic steroid cycle ended with all small ester steroids you will start your hCG therapy approximately 3 days after your last steroid injection. Conversely, if your anabolic steroid cycle ended with any large ester base steroids you will begin hCG therapy 10 days after your last steroid injection. Follow this protocol for hCG use combined with a quality Clomid cycle and you will not be disappointed in the results.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">50 mg/tab.

<p class=""subtitle"">Letrobol contains 2.5mg of Letrozole.</p>


<hr class=""hr_color"" />

<div class=""desc"">

Letrobol (Letrozole) is a non-steroidal selective third generation aromatase inhibitor used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen receptor-unknown breast cancer.

Letrobol (Letrozole) is highly favored by athletes for its ability to mitigate the estrogenic side effects associated with the use of aromatizable anabolic/androgenic steroids, such as gynecomastia, fat buildup, and visible water retention.
<h3>Side Effects</h3>
Common side effects associated with the use of an aromatase inhibitor include hot flashes, joint pain, weakness, fatigue, mood changes, depression, high blood pressure, swelling of the arms/ legs, and headache.

Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients.

Some individuals may also respond to the medication with gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting.

Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy.

When taken by men to reduce estrogenicity during prolonged periods of steroid treatment, aromatase inhibitors may increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by retarding some beneficial properties of estrogen on cholesterol values. Studies have demonstrated that when an aromatizable steroid such as testosterone enanthate is taken in conjunction with an aromatase inhibitor, suppression of HDL (good) cholesterol levels become significantly more pronounced.
<h3>Administration</h3>
To mitigate the estrogenic effects of anabolic/androgenic steroid use, a daily dosage of 1.25-2.5mg administered once per day, without regard to meals. In some cases a dosage of a half of a tablet (1.25 mg) taken every other day is sufficient to prevent the onset of estrogenic side effects.

<hr class=""hr_color"" />

<div class=""desc"">

Anastrobol (Anastrozole) is an anti-estrogenic drug developed for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women. It acts by blocking the enzyme aromatase, subsequently blocking the production of estrogen in the body.

In male bodybuilders and athletes, Anastrobol (Anastrozole) is commonly used to counter the side effects caused by elevated estrogens subsequent to the use of certain anabolic/androgenic steroids.
<h3>Side Effects</h3>
Common side effects associated with the use of an aromatase inhibitor include hot flashes, joint pain, weakness, fatigue, mood changes, depression, high blood pressure, swelling of the arms/ legs, and headache. Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients. Some individuals may also respond to the medication with gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting.

Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy.

When taken by men to reduce estrogenicity during prolonged periods of steroid treatment, aromatase inhibitors may increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by retarding some beneficial properties of estrogen on cholesterol values.

Studies have demonstrated that when an aromatizable steroid such as testosterone enanthate is taken in conjunction with an aromatase inhibitor, suppression of HDL (good) cholesterol levels become significantly more pronounced. Since the estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist Nolvadex generally does not display the same anti-estrogenic (negative) effect on cholesterol values, it is usually favored over aromatase inhibitors for estrogen maintenance by male bodybuilders and athletes concerned with cardiovascular health.
<h3>Administration</h3>
To mitigate the estrogenic side effects of anabolic/androgenic steroid use, male athletes and bodybuilders will commonly take 0.5 mg to 1 mg of Anastrobol (Anastrozole) per day. In some instances a half of a tablet (0.5 mg) taken every other day is sufficient to mitigate the buildup of estrogen.

When used with readily aromatizing androgens such as methandrostenolone or testosterone, gynecomastia and water retention are often effectively blocked.

Additionally, the use of Anastrobol (Anastrozole) may decrease fat mass, which can also be tied to estrogen levels. The result can be a harder and much more defined appearance to the muscles and physique, which makes this agent of interest for dieting/cutting purposes as well.

Food does not appear to affect the absorption of Anastrobol (Anastrozole), so the drug may be taken with or between meals.

<h3><strong><span id=""loopdiuretics"">What is a Loop Diuretic?</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Loop diuretics act at the ascending loop of Henle in the kidneys. Unlike thiazide diuretics, which are used mainly for hypertension, loop diuretics are more effective in patients with impaired kidney function.
<h3><strong><span id=""medicaluses"">Medical Uses in Humans</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Lasix is an important drug used for treatment of hypertension and edema, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the cavities of the body beneath the skin. Other medical uses include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hepatic cirrhosis</li>
 	<li>Renal impairment</li>
 	<li>Nephrotic syndrome</li>
 	<li>Severe hypercalcemia</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span id=""veterinarian"">Race Horses</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Lasix has been used to prevent race horses from bleeding through the nose during races due to exercised induced pulmonary hemorrhage (bleeding from the lungs).
<h3><strong><span id=""howworks"">How it Works</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Lasix will eliminate water and salt from the body very quickly. In the kidneys, salt, water, and other molecules are filtered out of the blood and into the tubules of the kidney; this fluid becomes urine. Most of the substances are reabsorbed into the blood before the filtered fluid becomes urine. Lasix works by blocking the absorption of the sodium, chloride, and water from the filtered fluid in the kidney tubules, causing an increase of urine output (diuresis).
<div id=""attachment_4755"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"">

<img class=""size-full wp-image-4755"" src=""https://www.evolutionary.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lasix-mechanism-of-action.jpg"" alt=""lasix mechanism of action"" width=""270"" height=""155"" />
<p class=""wp-caption-text"">Fig 2. Lasix Mechanism of Action</p>

</div>
<h3><strong><span id=""halflife"">Half Life</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

The half life of Lasix is listed as 2 hours. However, it is important to remember half life does not mean duration of how long the drug will work in the body. Injectable lasix will start working within minutes and the duration of diuresis is 2 hours. On the other hand, the oral version acts within an hour and lasts for about 6-8 hours. Significantly more Lasix is excreted in urine following IV injections than after the tablet solution.
<h3><strong><span id=""medicaldose"">Dosage for Medical Patients</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

There is an oral and IV/IM version of Lasix available. Depending on the patients medical condition and weight, the dosages will vary and a doctor will decide how best to proceed. For normal adults, 20-80mg dosage will cause prompt diuresis, and then a followup dosage is done 6-8 hours later. In patients with severe edema, dosages can go as high as 600mg per day, due to the absence of kidney functions (since it is a loop diuretic).
<h3><strong><span id=""bodybuildinganddosages"">Bodybuilding and Dosages</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Lasix is used by bodybuilders shortly before competitions, and sometimes up to two days beforehand, to excrete excessive water so that they appear hard, defined, and have a ripped physique on stage. The oral version of the compound is most popular with bodybuilders, but some athletes will use injections the morning of the competition. It is important to time Lasix perfectly or the muscles can become small and flat, and vascularity will be lost. In addition, you must have easy access to a restroom to urinate out the water. If too much blood volume is lost, the bodybuilder may have to inject glucose solution intravenously to offset that loss. Potassium levels will also drop, so it's wise to keep potassium tablets on hand. However, they should be used with extreme care, as too much potassium can be deadly. The exact dosages with diuretics will vary, so the athlete must experiment to get just the right amount, or it can become counter productive. A good strategy is to start with 10-20mgs then asses the tolerance levels, and go from there. With Lasix, more is definitely not better, and if this powerful diuretic is abused. it can lead to hospitalization and even death. Another strategy that is implemented deals with combining diuretics. Since Lasix has such a powerful effect on electrolyte and potassium levels, stacking it with a potassium sparing compound like Aldactone is synergetic. A stack of 50mg of aldactone and 20mg lasix is popular. Lasix should ONLY be used by the most experienced bodybuilders. I don't suggest it to new guys. This stuff can be deadly when abused, and bodybuilders have died after taking too much diuretics.
<h3><strong><span id=""sideeffects"">Side Effects</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

As you can imagine, a powerful diuretic can be very dangerous and the side effects are plentiful. If these symptoms begin, medical care may be needed.
<ul>
 	<li>Dizziness</li>
 	<li>Cramps</li>
 	<li>Vomiting</li>
 	<li>Fainting</li>
 	<li>Circulatory Disturbances</li>
</ul>
As mentioned, a potassium supplement (not overdosed) is important to keep on hand.
<h3><strong><span id=""wadaban"">WADA Ban</span></strong></h3>

<hr />

Lasix was placed on the World Anti Doping Agency's banned drug list due to its use as a masking agent for other drugs. Using lasix in WADA tested competitions will likely lead to a suspension.

<h2><strong>What is sibutramine?</strong></h2>
Sibutramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010. Sibutramine affects chemicals in the brain that affect weight maintenance. Sibutramine is used together with diet and exercise to treat obesity that may be related to diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. Sibutramine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.
<h2><strong>What is the most important information I should know about sibutramine?</strong></h2>
Sibutramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010. Do not use sibutramine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. Serious, life threatening side effects can occur if you use sibutramine before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body. You should not take sibutramine if you are allergic to it, or if you have severe or uncontrolled high blood pressure, an eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia), if you are taking stimulant diet pills, or if you have a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or heart disease. Before taking sibutramine, tell your doctor if you have glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease, depression, underactive thyroid, seizures, a bleeding disorder, a history of gallstones, or if you are older than 65 or younger than 16. Tell your doctor about all prescription and over-the-counter medications you use, especially antidepressants, cold or allergy medication, narcotic pain medicine, or migraine headache medicines. Tell your doctor if you do not lose at least 4 pounds after taking the medication for 4 weeks along with a low calorie diet.
<h2><strong>What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking sibutramine?</strong></h2>
Do not use sibutramine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. Serious, life threatening side effects can occur if you use sibutramine before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body. You should not take this medication if you are allergic to sibutramine, or if you have:
<ul>
 	<li>severe or uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure);</li>
 	<li>an eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia);</li>
 	<li>a history of coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis);</li>
 	<li>a history of heart disease (congestive heart failure, heart rhythm disorder);</li>
 	<li>a history of heart attack or stroke; or</li>
 	<li>if you are taking stimulant diet pills.</li>
</ul>
If you have any of these other conditions, you may need a sibutramine dose adjustment or special tests:
<ul>
 	<li>glaucoma;</li>
 	<li>high blood pressure;</li>
 	<li>liver disease;</li>
 	<li>kidney disease;</li>
 	<li>depression;</li>

The drug is most often prepared in 20 mcg tablets, but it is also available in syrup and injectable form. Clenbuterol belongs to a broad group of drugs knows as sympathomimetics. These drugs affect that sympathetic nervous system in a wide number of ways, largely mediated by the distribution of adrenoceptors. There are actually nine different types of these receptors in the body, which are classified as either alpha or beta and further subcategorized by type number. Depending on the specific affinities of these agents for the various receptors, they can potentially be used in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular shock, arrhythmias, migraine headaches and anaphylactic shock. The drug clenbuterol is specifically a selective beta-2 sympathomimetic, primarily affecting only one of the three subsets of beta-receptors. Of particular interest is the fact that this drug has little beta-1 stimulating activity. Since beta-1 receptors are closely tied to the cardiac effects of these agents, this allows clenbuterol to reduce reversible airway obstruction (and effect of beta-2 stimulation) with much less cardiovascular side effects compared to nonselective beta agonists. Clinical studies with this drug show it is extremely effective as a bronchodilator, with a low level of user complaints and high patient compliance. Clenbuterol also exhibits an extremely long half-life in the body, which is measured to be approximately 34 hours long. This makes steady blood levels easy to achieve, requiring only a single or twice daily dosing schedule at most. This of course makes it much easier for the patient to use, and may tie in to its high compliance rate. To spite that clenbuterol is available in a wide number of other countries however; this compound has never been approved for use in the United States. The fact that there are a number of similar, effective asthma medications already available in this country may have something to do with this, as a prospective drug firm would likely not find it a profitable enough product to warrant undergoing the expense of the FDA approval process. Regardless, foreign clenbuterol preparations are widely available on the U.S. black market. In animal studies clenbuterol is shown to exhibit anabolic activity, obviously an attractive trait to the athlete This compound is additionally a known thermogenic, with beta-2 agonists like clenbuterol shown to directly stimulate fat cells and accelerate the breakdown of triglycerides to form free fatty acids. Its efficacy in this area makes clenbuterol a very attractive, and today almost mandatory, pre-contest drug. Those interested in this drug are most often hoping it will impart a little of both benefits, promoting the loss of body fat while imparting strength and muscle mass increases. But as was well pointed out by a review published in the August 1995 issue of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, the possible anabolic activities in humans are very questionable, and based only on animal data using much larger doses than would be required for bronchodilation . With such reports there has been a lot of debate lately as to whether or not clenbuterol is really anabolic at all. Some seem to swear by the fact that it builds muscle regardless, firmly sticking by ""clen"" as a great off-season or adjunct anabolic. To others such reports are confirmation that athletes have wasted valuable time and money on drugs that do not work as they are intended to by the user. This debate continues today, with many still using clenbuterol as a potential anabolic. With this in mind athletes will tailor their dosage and cycling of this product individually depending on which of the two ""possible"" results are more desired, and how much side effects are to be tolerated. The possible side effects of clenbuterol include those of other CNS stimulants, and include such occurrences as shaky hands, insomnia, sweating, increased blood pressure and nausea. These side effects will generally subside after a week or so of use however, once the user becomes accustomed to the drug. One would typically start a cycle by gradually increasing the dosage each day until a desired range is established. This process will minimize the unwanted side effects seen from the drug; which otherwise might be dramatic if a large dose is administered from the onset. Men generally end up in the range of 2-8 tablets per day, although some people do claim to tolerate even higher dosages. Women get by on less, generally 2-4 tablets daily. Very quickly, the drug will elevate the body temperature. The rise is not usually dramatic, perhaps a half of a degree or so, sometimes a little more. This elevation is due to your body burning excess energy (largely from fat) and is usually not uncomfortable. Now that it is working, the number of consecutive days clenbuterol can be used is believed to be dependent on the goal of the individual. To be clear, the athletic benefits of this drug will only last for a limited time and then diminish, largely due to beta-receptor down regulation. When using it for fat loss, the primary effect of the drug, it seems to work well for approximately 4-6 weeks. During this period, users will want to constantly monitor their body temperature. We are assured clenbuterol is working by the temperature elevation. Once the temperature drops back to normal, clenbuterol is no longer exhibiting a thermogenic effect. At this point increasing the dosage would not be very effective, and a break for at least a few weeks should be taken before it is used again effectively. If one is looking for strength gains, clenbuterol appears to be effective for a much shorter period of time, around 3-4 weeks. This may be due to an absence of real anabolic effect, with the strength gain seen with clenbuterol possibly due only to the stimulant properties of the drug (similar to the strength boost seen by ephedrine users). Again however, this is still debated. Many competitors also find the fat burning effect of clenbuterol can be further enhanced by additional substances. When combined with thyroid hormones, specifically the powerful Cytomel, the thermogenic effect can become extremely dramatic. This can be to a point that the athlete could shred exceptional amounts of extra fat during contest preparations, without a dramatic restriction in calories. Such a mix can be further used during a steroid cycle, eliciting a much harder look from the anabolics. These cutting agents can often greatly inhibit extra fat storage during the cycle, even when using strong aromatizing androgens. A clenbuterol/thyroid mix is also common when using growth hormone, further enhancing the thermogenic and anabolic effect of this therapy.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">0,04 mg/tab.

Each tablet contains 25 mcg of Liothyronine Sodium.</p><hr class=""hr_color"" /><div class=""desc"">Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium) is a synthetically manufactured prescription thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones stimulate basal metabolic rate, and are involved with many cellular functions including protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium) is used medically to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormone.<h2>Side Effects</h2>Side effects are generally associated with overdosage, and may include headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, irregular heartbeat, increased bowel motility, or menstrual irregularities. Overdosage may also induce shock, and may aggravate or trigger angina or congestive heart failure. Chronic overexposure to Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium) will produce symptoms normally associated with hyperthyroidism or the overproduction of natural thyroid hormones in the body. The occurrence of overexposure-linked side effects is normally cause to immediately reduce or discontinue therapy with Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium). Acute massive overdose may be life threatening.<h2>Administration</h2>When used to treat mild hypothyroidism, the typical recommended starting dosage is 1 tablet (25 mcg Liothyronine sodium) daily. The daily dosage then may be increased by no more than 1 tablet (25 mcg Liothyronine sodium) every 1 to 2 weeks. The established maintenance dose is usually 1-3 tablets (25-75 mcg Liothyronine sodium) per day. Once a day administration of the full daily dose is usually recommended. Although Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium) is fast acting, its effects may persist in the body for several days after discontinuance. Cycles of Thyrobol (Liothyronine sodium) usually last no longer than 6 weeks, and administration of the drug should not be halted abruptly. Instead, it is discontinued in the same slow manner in which it was initiated. This usually entails reducing the dosage by 1 tablet (25 mcg Liothyronine sodium) every 4 to 7 days. This tapering is done so that the body has time to readjust its endogenous hormone production at the conclusion of therapy, and to avoid the onset of side effects.</div>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">25 mcg/tab.

Human growth hormone is important in the body for the growth of bones and muscles. Somatropin is used to treat growth failure in children and adults who lack natural growth hormone, and in those with chronic kidney failure, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature at birth with no catch-up growth, and other causes. Somatropin is also used to prevent severe weight loss in people with AIDS, or to treat short bowel syndrome. Somatropin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2><strong>What is the most important information I should know about Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></h2><p>Before you receive somatropin, tell your doctor about all your past and present medical conditions, especially allergies, trauma, surgery, diabetes, cancer, breathing problems, liver or kidney disease, scoliosis, high blood pressure, pancreas disorder, underactive thyroid, or a brain tumor. Also tell your doctor about all other medications you use, especially steroids or diabetes medications. Your dosages of these medicines may need to be changed when you start using somatropin. Do not stop using a steroid suddenly or change any of your medication doses without your doctor's advice. If you have Prader-Willi syndrome and are using somatropin, call your doctor promptly if you develop signs of lung or breathing problems such as shortness of breath, coughing, or new or increased snoring. Call your doctor at once if you have sudden and severe pain in your upper stomach with nausea and vomiting, fast heartbeat, increased thirst or urination, weight loss, or vision changes and sudden, severe pain behind your eyes.</p><h2><strong>What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before using Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></h2><p>Before you receive somatropin, tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a growth hormone medicine, or to drug preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, metacresol or glycerin. You should not use this medication if you are allergic to somatropin, or if you have:</p><ul><li>diabetic retinopathy (a serious eye condition caused by diabetes);</li><li>cancer; or</li><li>Prader-Willi syndrome and are also overweight or have sleep apnea or severe respiratory (lung) problems.</li></ul><p>You should also not use somatropin if you have a serious medical condition after having:</p><ul><li>open heart surgery or stomach surgery;</li><li>trauma or other medical emergency; or</li><li>breathing problems (such as lung failure).</li></ul><p>To make sure you can safely take somatropin, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions:</p><ul><li>liver disease;</li><li>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</li><li>diabetes;</li><li>a pituitary gland disorder;</li><li>scoliosis;</li><li>high blood pressure (hypertension);</li><li>a pancreas disorder (especially in children);</li><li>a history of cancer;</li><li>carpal tunnel syndrome;</li><li>underactive thyroid; or</li><li>a brain tumor or lesion.</li></ul><p>FDA pregnancy category B. Some brands of somatropin are not expected to harm an unborn baby, including Genotropin, Omnitrope, Saizen, Serostim, and Zorbtive. FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether certain other brands of somatropin will harm an unborn baby, including Humatrope, Norditropin, Nutropin, and Tev-tropin. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this medication. It is not known whether somatropin passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Do not use somatropin without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2><strong>How should I use Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></h2><p>Use exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Your dose and brand of somatropin, and how often you give it will depend on what you are being treated for. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Somatropin is injected into a muscle or under the skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not self-inject this medicine if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes. Use a different place on your body each time you give the injection. Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject the medication. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Do not inject this medicine into skin or muscle that is red, sore, infected, or injured. Do not shake the medication bottle or you may ruin the medicine. When mixing somatropin with a diluent (liquid), use a gentle swirling motion. Do not use the medication if it has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your doctor for a new prescription. Use a disposable needle only once. Throw away used needles in a puncture-proof container (ask your pharmacist where you can get one and how to dispose of it). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets. To be sure this medication is helping your condition and not causing harm, your blood and growth progress will need to be tested often. Your eyes may also need to be checked. Visit your doctor regularly. If you are being treated for short bowel syndrome, follow the diet plan created for you by your doctor or nutrition counselor to help control your condition. Somatropin is not a cure for short bowel syndrome. If you use a form of somatropin that comes in a cartridge for use with an injection pen, use only the pen injection system provided with the somatropin brand you use. How you store this medicine will depend on what brand you are using and what diluent you are mixing somatropin with. After mixing somatropin, you may need to use it right away or you may be able to store it for later use. Read and carefully follow the instructions provided with your medicine about proper storage of somatropin before and after it has been mixed. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about proper storage of your medication. Throw away any somatropin left over after the expiration date on the label has passed.</p><h2><strong>What happens if I miss a dose?</strong></h2><p>Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose. Call your doctor if you miss more than 3 doses in a row.</p><h2><strong>What happens if I overdose?</strong></h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Overdose can cause tremors or shaking, cold sweats, increased hunger, headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, fast heartbeat, and nausea. Long-term overdose may cause excessive growth.</p><h2><strong>What should I avoid while using Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></h2><p>If you use Zorbtive to treat short bowel syndrome, avoid drinking fruit juices or soda beverages. Follow the instructions of your doctor or nutrition counselor about what types of liquids you should drink while using Zorbtive. Avoid drinking alcohol if you have short bowel syndrome. Alcohol can irritate your stomach and could make your condition worse.</p><h2><strong>Genotropin (somatropin) side effects</strong></h2><p>If you have Prader-Willi syndrome, call your doctor promptly if you develop signs of lung or breathing problems such as shortness of breath, coughing, or new or increased snoring. Rare cases of serious breathing problems have occurred in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who use somatropin. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:</p><ul><li>severe pain in your upper stomach spreading to your back, nausea and vomiting, fast heart rate;</li><li>increased thirst, increased urination, hunger, dry mouth, fruity breath odor, drowsiness, dry skin, blurred vision, and weight loss;</li><li>sudden and severe pain behind your eyes, vision changes;</li><li>swelling in your head, face, hands, or feet; or</li><li>numbness or tingling in your wrist, hand, or fingers.</li></ul><p>Less serious side effects may include:</p><ul><li>headache, feeling tired;</li><li>redness, soreness, swelling, rash, itching, pain, or bruising where the medicine was injected;</li><li>pain in your arms or legs, joint stiffness or pain;</li><li>muscle pain; or</li><li>cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat.</li></ul><h2><strong>What other drugs will affect Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></h2><p>Before using somatropin, tell your doctor if you use insulin or take oral (by mouth) medicine to treat diabetes. Somatropin may affect blood sugar levels and you may need to adjust your dose of the diabetes medication. Do not change the dose of your diabetes medication without your doctor's advice. Tell your doctor if you use any type of steroid medicine such as cortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, and others. Steroids can make somatropin less effective and your doses may need to be adjusted. Do not stop using a steroid suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions. Tell your doctor about all other medications you use, especially cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), seizure medication, birth control pills, anabolic steroids, or hormone replacement medications for men or women. This list is not complete and other drugs may interact with somatropin. Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor.</p><h2><strong>Where can I get more information?</strong></h2><p>Your pharmacist has additional information about genotropin written for health professionals that you may read.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10iu (3,33mg) / 5x 10iu (50iu)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: MAGNUSTROPIN 50iu kit

Dianabol promotes protein synthesis and supports the buildup of protein. This effect engenders a positive nitrogen balance and an enhanced sense of well-being. Positive influence is exerted on the bodily calcium balance as well because Dianabol promotes calcium deposits in the bones. Dianabol is otherwise indicated in the treatment of all diseases and conditions wherein an anabolic (protein-buildup promoting) effect and a generally roborizing (entire organism strengthening) effect is desired. Similar in chemical structure to 17-Alpha Methyltestosterone, Dianabol, has a very strong anabolic and androgenic effect which manifests itself in an enormous buildup of strength and muscle mass in users. Dianabol is simply a 'mass steroid' which works quickly and reliably. A weight gain of 2 - 4 pounds per week in the first six weeks is normal. This additional body weight is a true increase in tissue (hypertrophy of muscle fibers) and more particularly, in an increased retention of fluids. Dianabol aromatizes easily and hence is not a very good pre-competition drug. Excessive water retention and aromatizing into estrogen can be mostly avoided by simultaneously taking Nolvadex and Proviron. This enables some athletes to use Dianabol up to three to four days before a competition.</p><h3><strong>Dianabol - Dosage Do's</strong></h3><p>Bodybuilders, weightlifters and powerlifters have a very wide dosage space with Dianabol. And this ranges from two tablets per day up to twenty or more tablets per day. An effective daily dose for athletes is around 15-40 mg/day. Dosage of Dianabol is adjustable with the athlete's individual goal. Steroid novices can achieve exceptional results over a period of 8-10 weeks with just 15-20 mg per day. After which, as results slow down, the dosage of Dianabol should not be increased but an injectable steroid such as Deca Durabolin in a dosage of 200 mg/week or Primobolan in a dosage of 200 mg/week should be used, in addition to the Dianabol dose. A complete switch to one of the two above mentioned compounds can also be made. The use of testosterone is generally not recommended at this stage as it leaves the athlete space for free play later. But for the impatient lot or the more advanced kind, a stack of Dianabol 20-30 mg/day and Deca Durabolin 200-400 mg/day achieves miracles. Athletes who are not in the competition bracket make highly satisfying progress with Dianabol. Competing athletes, more advanced athletes, and athletes weighing more than 220 pounds do not need more than 40 mg/day and in very rare cases 50 mg/day. Increasing the number of Dianabol tablets immeasurably doesn't make any difference since fifteen tablets do not double the effect of seven or eight. Daily dosages of 60 mg+ usually are due to the athlete's ignorance or plain despair, since in some athletes, owing to the continued improper intake of steroids, nothing seems to be effective any more.</p><h3><strong>Dianabol - In Combination</strong></h3><p>Combining Dianabol and Anadrol is not a good idea as these two compounds have similar effects and is more like doubling a normal dosage! Those preferring strength to body mass can combine Dianabol with either Anavar or Winstrol tabs. The additional intake of an injectable steroid does, however, clearly show the best results. To build up both mass and strength, Sustanon or Testoviron Depot at 250 mg+/week and/or Deca Durabolin 200 at mg+/week are ideal. Dianabol causes distinct water retention in many athletes and due to its high conversion rate into estrogen it complicates the athlete's fat breakdown and hence is not the ideal pre-competition stuff. Those without this hang-up and who are able to control it by taking Nolvadex or Proviron, in this phase, should use Dianabol together with the proven Parabolan, Winstrol Depot, Masteron, Anavar, etc. Dianabol's half life time is only 3.2-4.5 hours, so one application at least twice a day is necessary to achieve a somewhat even concentration of the substance in the blood. On days of intense workout compared to rest days, the half-life time of Dianabol is further reduced so that an application three times daily appears sensible. Since Dianabol is also 17-alpha alkylated. It is recommended to take the tablets during meals so that possible gastrointestinal pains can be avoided. On the third day after discontinuing the intake of Dianabol, proof of the substance methandrostenolone (methandienone) in the blood is negative. But a urine test may not be negative since the elimination of the metabolites of the substance methandrostenolone through the urine takes much longer. An important reason why Dianabol works well in all athletes is that it reduces endogenous cortisone production by as much as 50-70%. Thus, Dianabol considerably slows down the rate at which protein is broken down in the muscle cell.</p><h3><strong>Dianabol and Women</strong></h3><p>Dianabol has a distinctive androgenic component and can cause considerable virilization symptoms to occur in women. There are several exceptional female bodybuilders and powerlifters who use Dianabol and obtain enormous progress with 10-20 mg/day. Women who do not exhibit sensitivity to the additional intake of androgens or who are not afraid of possible masculinization symptoms get on well with 2-4 tablets over a period not exceeding 4-6 weeks. Higher dosages over a longer time of intake bring better results; however the androgens begin to be more noticeable too in the female organism. The bottomline is - no woman who continues to care about her femininity should take more than 10 mg/day and 50-100 mg of Deca Durabolin/week over 4-6 weeks.</p><h3><strong>Dianabol - Side Effects</strong></h3><p>Dianabol does have many potential side effects, but they are rare with a dosage of up to 20 mg/day. Since Dianabol is 17-alpha alkylated it causes a considerable strain on the liver. In high dosages and over a longer period of time, Dianabol is liver-toxic. Even a dosage of only 10 mg/day can increase the liver values; after discontinuance of the drug, however, the values return to normal. Dianabol quickly increases body weight due to high water retention, and high blood pressure and a faster heartbeat can occur, sometimes requiring the intake of an antihypertensive drug such as Catapresan. As Dianabol readily converts into estrogen and in some athletes causes gynecomastia ('bitch tits') or worsens an already existing condition additional intake of Nolvadex and Proviron might become necessary. Because of its strongly androgenic component and the conversion into Dihydrotestosterone, Dianabol has a significant influence on the endogenous testosterone level. Studies have shown that the intake of 20 mg Dianabol/day over 10 days reduces the testosterone level by 30-40%. This could probably be explained by Dianabol's distinct antigonadotropic effect, which inhibits the release of the gonadotropic FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) by hypophysis. Immediately after discontinuing Dianabol, a considerable loss of strength and mass often occurs since the water stored during the intake is again excreted by the body. In high dosages of 50 mg+/ day aggressive behavior in the user can occasionally be observed and if restricted to working out, is beneficial. Those who have a tendency to easily lose their temper should be aware of this characteristic when taking a high D-bol dosage. In spite of all of these possible symptoms Dianabol continues to instill in most athletes a 'sense of well-being.' This improves their mood and appetite and in many users, together with the obtained results, leads to an improved level of consciousness and a higher self-confidence.</p><h3><strong>Dianabol - Take What's not Fake</strong></h3><p>According to our experience the Thailandian Anabol tablets and the Indian Pronabol-5 are the best and most genuine compounds. The 'Thai-landians,' as they are often called by their users are pentagonally shaped, of pink color and indented. One thousand tablets are packaged in a plastic bag which is contained in a labelled plastic box the size of a drinking glass. Note that the manufacturing date and not the expiration date is printed on the label. The plastic box is usually also shrink-wrapped. The price for a 1000-package lies around $500-$ 1000 on the black market. The Indian Pronabol-5, simply called 'Pronas,' is enclosed in an oblong box with ten strips of 10 tablets each. These tablets are round, white, and indented on one side. The original Pronas can be easily recognized since they come in a silver aluminum strip with a double bottom, and have a purple imprint so that the tablets are invisible. Since the fake Pronabols are indented as well one must make certain not to purchase tablets in bulk or tablets contained in a normal push-through strip. Original Pronas, cost approximately $ 100 per package on the black market. Other easily available original compounds are the Polish Metanabol and the Czech Stenoion. Since 1994, Polish Metanabol has only been available in blister strips of 10 tablets each, of orange color, and with their own packaging. The Czech Stenolon tablets have two indents on one side and come in push-through strips of 20 tablets. Each push-through strip is included in a yellow-grey package. Note that there is no package insert since the entire user information is printed on the back of the small carton. On the black market usually only individual strips without packaging can be found since the packaging takes up too much room when smuggled. Because of the interesting price of these two compounds it is not unusual to find athletes who take twenty or more tablets daily. The Rumanian Naposim contains 20 tablets in 2 blisters. The Russian Dianabol is packaged in push-through strips of ten tablets each. Ten push-through strips are contained in a green box or are held together by a black rubber band and a rag similar to toilet paper. The imprint on the push-through strips is either blue or</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">25 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Averbol 25 (injectable methandienone), 25 mg/ml (10 ml), British Dragon</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 07:57:24",1,open,326,,,no,no,,80,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/averbol-25.jpg ! alt :  ! title : averbol-25 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/averbol-25/,2,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Injectable Steroids > Methandienone Injection","buy averbol",

Even so, Primo, as it is most commonly called remains as one of those sort of “Mystical” steroids simply for the stigma that surrounds it as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s favorites and due to this label it remains possessing a diehard cult like following. Was it Arnold’s absolute favorite? Only he can answer that and while he’s mentioned several steroids nonchalantly over the years for whatever reason this has been the one most have grabbed hold of. Regardless of Arnold’s love or hate of the steroid it remains true; Primobolan is one of the safest and most highly well-tolerated anabolic steroids of all time and this includes in both men and women. Many over the years like to compare Primo to another fairly well-tolerated steroid Masteron but as we will see this isn’t really a completely fair and accurate comparison. However, like Masteron and many other anabolic steroids Primobolan is commonly counterfeited but in this case Primo is one of the most commonly counterfeited <strong>steroids</strong> of all time. It should come as no surprise; while not as popular as it once was it still has a decent demand and many first time users with visions of Arnold in their head will buy the first batch they see. However, for those who do desire and find legitimate Primobolan will in-fact have found a very mild and safe anabolic hormone that is especially well-suited for cutting cycles and very easy to control. Understand when you do find it you can expect to pay a pretty penny, for this is one of the more expensive anabolic steroids on the market.</p><h3>Primobolan:</h3><p>A Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derivative, Primobolan is the common trade name largely associated with the Methenolone steroid and comes in both an oral and injectable form. Carrying with it both anabolic and androgenic traits injectable Primobolan comes in the form of Methenolone-Enanthate, while the oral tablet as Methenolone-Acetate; in either case you are receiving the same hormone and while this isn’t the only steroid available in both forms in this case one is far superior to the other. As both anabolic and androgenic the androgenic nature of the hormone is rather low as it is far more anabolic; further, as is by its nature Primo in any form will not aromatize and this can often be a most welcomed trait. Milligram for milligram injectable Primobolan is far more powerful than the oral Methenolone version and the reason is very simple; unlike most oral anabolic steroids oral Primobolan is not 17-alpha-alkylated (17-aa). As you recall the 17-aa structural change allows oral steroids to survive ingestion;oral steroids that do not possess this trait are often destroyed by the body before they can be used or at least a large portion of the ingested hormone is. Oral Primo will still work but a large portion of each milligram will not survive the first pass through the liver. At the same time the oral version is not without a benefit; most oral anabolic steroids carry with them a high toxicity rating due to the 17-aa structural change and as Primobolan is absent this change its toxicity is very low; in-fact, oral Primo really isn’t liver toxic at all. When we look at <strong>injectable Methenolone</strong> we do not have to worry about toxicity either but we also find the hormonal compound to be far more valuable; so much so that we would always recommend injectable Primobolan over the oral version.</p><h3>The Benefits of Primobolan:</h3><p>There are some very powerful DHT steroids on the market, Anadrol, Winstrol and Halotestin being the most powerful of all but as these are very powerful steroids, Anadrol being the most powerful of all, in comparison Primobolan, although a DHT in nature too is far milder. Unlike Anadrol Primobolan is not a good bulking steroid and to gain any real benefit during a bulking cycle from Primo use you would necessarily need to supplement with massive amounts. If there is one benefit Primobolan has that is truly beneficial it is in its ability to preserve muscle tissue while dieting and this is a very welcomed trait as muscle tissue is very easy to lose when calories are restricted. Further, Primo does fantastic work on our overall metabolic function and while many anabolic steroids do the same Primobolan is one of the few that directly promotes fat-loss. In the end, when used while leaning out Primo will lend to a physique that is leaner and harder and one that carries more lean tissue than it would have had Primo been missing. As eluded to above Primobolan is also a fantastic steroid for women; in-fact it is one of the few that is very well-tolerated by most women who supplement, second only to Anavar but it is a very close second. Many women have to be very careful when they supplement with anabolic steroids as they are primarily testosterone based and such increases in hormones can bring havoc to a woman’s femininity in the form of virilization. Virilization effects can be pretty harsh, as stated they can dramatically effect a woman based on her very femininity and can cause such effects as deepening of the vocal chords, body hair growth, clitoral enlargement, and even hair-loss in the frontal area of the scalp just to name a few. However, when we look at Primobolan we find the issue of virilization to be very low; in-fact it is extremely low but it can still occur to a degree; individual sensitivity will play a big part. Most women will find they can supplement with Primo for at least 4 weeks and often up to 6 without any negative effects and receive a decent anabolic bump; however, if adverse effects start to show and a woman discontinues use immediately they will reverse and be of no concern any longer. In the same light yet in the opposite direction, women who continue use in-spite of adverse effects will see these effects take hold in a more permanent way.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Primobolan:</h3><p>While all anabolic steroids have a potential for negative or adverse side-effects the extent of this probability varies with each one and in the case of Primo the probability is about as low as it can get, especially when used responsibly. As you already understand Primobolan does not possess an aromatizing effect, therefore some of the more common associated anabolic steroid side-effects such as Gynecomastia and water retention are of no concern; further, we cannot ignore that it is also very liver friendly indeed. Of the possible side-effects they will be very similar to other popular DHT based steroids; the side-effects of Winstrol are applicable here but to a far less degree. Issues of hair-loss and prostate enlargement can be of a slight concern; however, very few men will ever experience any negative effect on the prostate and those that lose any hair were going to lose it any way; DHT based steroids simply speed up what is already coming.</p><h3>Primobolan &amp; Suppression:</h3><p>In the world of anabolic androgenic steroids there are often more myths than truths and it can be hard to decipher which is which, especially when you’re first starting out. Unfortunately many of these myths survive into the veteran ranks, for if you learned a lie early on you’ll more than likely still believe it later on. Of all the myths and lies there is one that surrounds Primo with more gusto than most and it revolves around testosterone suppression. It is understood by most, the use of anabolic steroids suppresses natural testosterone production, and even the use of exogenous testosterone suppresses natural testosterone production. The degree of suppression varies with each steroid but the prevailing myth held by many is that Primobolan doesn’t suppress and on this belief many like to use it as a bridging agent between cycles. Let’s put this lie to rest once and for all; absolutely, <strong>Primobolan suppresses natural testosterone</strong>, in-fact a very low dose of Primo can suppress natural production by as much as 50% and we’re talking about one dose and not taking into account multiple doses spread out over a course of weeks. How suppressive is it, how much Primo does it take to suppress 50% of your natural testosterone production? Assuming your Primo is real, remember, there is a lot of counterfeit product, a mere <strong>25mg will cause a 50% suppression rate</strong> making the idea of bridging with Primobolan rather stupid.</p><h3>Primobolan Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>As a mild steroid, while most men who supplement will use it while dieting they will still need to take a fairly large amount to gain any positive effect. If you supplement with oral Primo you will need even more per week than if you choose injectable and as both are very expensive; as you can guess this cost will add up very fast. Most men who try <em>Primobolan </em>and who are disappointed on the basis of no results are usually found lacking simply because they didn’t take enough; for example, an average man will need approximately <strong>500mg per week</strong> of injectable Primo to receive a benefit and he will need to do so <strong>for at least 8 weeks</strong>. Yes, you can absolutely take more and for a longer period of time but if you do be prepared to feel your wallet get a whole lot lighter. You may have already guessed, while Primobolan can be used by men if we were to recommend it to anyone it would be the female performance enhancer first; not only because it will be tolerated so well by her but because she will not need nearly as much making it all the more affordable and feasible. Again, injectable Primo will prove to be best but to ensure safety and protection against virilization is in place most women will not want to exceed <strong>6 weeks of use</strong> max with <strong>4 weeks of use</strong>generally being the minimal time frame. For women who want more they can absolutely run another course but it is advised that 4 weeks of discontinued use be held to before another course begins. For the average woman most will find 100mg per week to be sufficient; you can go higher but the higher you go the greater the risk. You may need to play with the dosing a little bit but 100mg is a good place to start and 2 injections per week of 50mg each is just about perfect.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Primobol 100 (methenolone enanthate) 100 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon (Thailand)</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 08:01:49",1,open,330,,,no,no,,95,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/primobol-100.jpg ! alt :  ! title : primobol-100 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/primobol-100/,13,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Injectable Steroids > Primobolan (Methenolone Enanthate)","buy primobol",

not only among gym rats but professional athletes as well. The reason is simple, although not the most potent anabolic steroid available, its generally one of the best all-purpose anabolics we have. Further, Equipoise is an anabolic steroid easily tolerated well by many women which in the case of many anabolics can be a rarity; there are very few anabolic steroids available that dont produce often horrendous side-effects in women. In short, Equipoise is a steroid that can and is used in just about every group of athlete, male or female, professional or otherwise. Like many anabolic steroids Equipoise was not first developed for human use but like many steroids a use was found. Its original intent was for horses, not human beings but generally what works for one mammal will work for another; especially in the case of anabolic steroids.</p><h2>Equipoise Characteristics</h2><p>Because of the Undeclynate ester attached Equipoise is a slow acting steroid, much like the Decanoate ester; an ester commonly associated with long-slow acting anabolics. The half-life of Equipoiseis approximately fourteen (14) days making the need for frequent injections irrelevant on paper. However, many performance athletes will regularly inject the drug multiple times per week to maintain stable levels, as is common practice with many various anabolics. Common beneficial attributes of Equipoise include:</p><ul><li>Increased Protein Synthesis</li><li>Increased Nitrogen Levels</li><li>Increased Red-Blood Cell Counts</li><li>Appetite Stimulation</li></ul><p>The after-mentioned are some of the very positive effects of Equipoise however it should be noted, as a high quality anabolic, Equipoise is not a well-suited steroid for large increases in muscle mass. If we were to list its strongest attributes they would include:</p><ul><li>Increased Strength</li><li>Increased Vascularity</li><li>Muscle Tissue Preservation</li></ul><p>The increase in strength is a huge factor for many athletes who use <strong>Equipoise</strong> including ball players and some power lifters. However, in physique sports or for the everyday gym rat, many find its use to be best when dieting and leaning out. Granted, the increased appetite can be a problem for less disciplined individuals but it should be noted, this effect does not present itself in every Equipoise user.</p><h3>Boldenone- Undeclynate Equipoise vs. Nandrolone-Decanoate (Deca-Durabolin)</h3><p>Enter any steroid related message board and you will find a many misguided opinions on this topic. Lets be clear, these two anabolic steroids are not, repeat NOT interchangeable. These two anabolic steroids do not mimic each other in the slightest; in-fact they are very different. For a pure mass building effect<strong> Deca-Durabolin</strong> will always prove to be far more useful. One can gain mass from the use of Equipoise but not to the degree of Deca. The biggest reason for this misunderstanding is misguided information when Equipoise first hit the market, due largely in-part to the late Dan Duchaine who claimed the two drugs were similar; however, shortly after, Duchaine recanted but the myth never died. If we were to compare any anabolic steroid to Equipoise it would be testosterone; the two are very similar in composition, while in comparison to Deca they could not be any more different. Granted, both will shut your natural testosterone production down, as do most anabolics and both are good drugs for strength, but they also possess opposing traits, chemically and most notably the fact Equipoise does not possess the progestin qualities of Deca. In short, when you hear someone say you cant use both in the same cycle, ignore them; theres no logic behind this argument.</p><h3>Equipoise &amp; Women</h3><p>Equipoise is generally viewed as one of the few anabolic steroids easily tolerated by females. The largest concern for most female anabolic users is virilization effects and these seem to be slightly to even non-existent in most females who use the drug responsibly. Many women use this steroid with great success as part of a stack; however, expect the results to be far more potent than other common female stacks such as Anavar and Primobolan.</p><h3>Equipoise Detection &amp; Legality</h3><p>Equipoise has one of the longest detection times of any anabolic steroid; if you are a tested athlete you are urged to forgo its use. <em>Equipoise</em> can be detected in the urine for months even after use has been discontinued; some studies have claimed they can trace the drug back to as far as one year from the end of use. In most countries Equipoise is not legally obtainable; in most cases only through purchase from an underground lab can this drug be obtained. For that reason it is very important you understand the laws in the country you live.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">200 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Boldabol 200 (boldenone undecylenate), 200 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon (Thailand)</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 08:05:00",1,open,332,,,no,no,,95,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/boldabol-200.jpg ! alt :  ! title : boldabol-200 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/boldabol-200/,35,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"Injectable Steroids > Boldenone Undecylenate (Equipoise)|British Dragon|Injectable Steroids","buy boldabol",

It is also one of the most popular performance enhancing steroids of all time the world over and if you’ve ever considered anabolic androgenic steroids there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Testosterone-Cypionate. As are all testosterone forms Testosterone-Cypionate is highly anabolic and androgenic with an anabolic and androgenic rating of 100 in each; in-fact, it is the anabolic and androgenic rating of testosterone by-which all anabolic androgenic steroids are measured. As Testosterone-Cypionate is just that, 100% pure testosterone, you will find it to be a perfect anabolic steroid for almost any purpose and one of the most efficiently well-tolerated anabolic hormones of all. As we look at this compound and try to gain an understanding you will find there are two key points of interest in gaining the knowledge you need; understanding the hormone testosterone itself and how the Cypionate ester that is attached affects it. By this understanding you will discover that all testosterone is virtually the same, as the hormone itself does not change due to the ester that is attached; the ester is not a hormone but rather a mechanism attached to the hormone that affects its activity and total action.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce and it is a hormone all human beings naturally produce, both men and women. While men require nearly ten times the amount of women, in both sexes the hormone plays host to numerous responsibilities in the body that range from muscle tissue growth and preservation, metabolic and sexual function to a host of others all comprising of a well-functioning endocrine system. Many individuals the world over suffer from <strong>low levels of the testosterone hormone</strong>, the most common cause being age. As men age their natural testosterone levels decline but this effect can be seen in women as well, especially women who are post-menopause and <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate </strong>is often the means by-which it is remedied. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone he or she may experience a host of problems ranging from muscle and strength loss, a loss of libido and sexual function, increased body-fat, depression, a weakened immune system to a host of other ailments and conditions. In most cases such conditions are easily treated by simply supplementing with a testosterone based hormone and by simply returning levels to a stable yet normal level will in most cases see such conditions resolved. In a strong sense we can look at TRT therapy in a similar light when examining performance enhancement, the difference simply being taking our testosterone levels beyond the normal range, thereby enhancing the effects of the hormone even more so. For the majority of performance enhancers this will revolve around muscle growth and preservation, increasing strength and overall athletic performance as well as <strong>improving metabolic activity within the body</strong>. <em>Testosterone-Cypionate</em> use is one of the best methods of achieving such goals as its direct mode of action simply promotes their enhancement. As is caused by the presence of testosterone the hormone dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis and further enhances red blood cells by increasing the amount and structural capacity. Testosterone also has the ability to block and reduce glucocorticoid hormones in the body, also known as muscle wasting hormones; the most famous of all being cortisol. These hormones, often referred to as “<strong>stress hormones</strong>” can have disastrous effects as they destroy muscle tissue and promote fat gain, all leading to slower metabolic activity and making fat-loss more difficult than it needs to be. Further and of particular interest, when the testosterone hormone is present in levels beyond therapeutic measure our natural IGF-1 levels increase and as IGF-1 is a powerful anabolic hormone itself, a hormone that plays a key role within every cell of the body, our total activity in both an anabolic and metabolic nature increases yet again. Now that you have an understanding of testosterone the obvious point of interest is how does the Cypionate ester play a role and function. The ester of the steroid is largely what determines the steroids half-life and the larger the ester the longer the half-life will be. The ester attached also affects a particular steroids initial activity but and while not of particular great importance it also affects the compounds total mass. The larger the ester the more mass it takes up in the compound; for example,<strong>100mg of testosterone with no ester attached is simply 100mg of testosterone whereas 100mg of testosterone with an ester attached will be a little less than 100mg of actual hormone</strong>; how much less will be determined by the size of the ester. In the case of Testosterone-Cypionate we have a compound that carries with it a moderately long half-life as Cypionate is a fairly large ester; the half-life of Testosterone-Cypionate is approximately 12 days long. As a long ester based anabolic steroid the effects of the compound will not be felt very fast but the total activity will stretch past much further than smaller ester based forms such as Testosterone-Propionate. To understand how the half-life works is fairly simple; <strong>when we inject 200mg of testosterone Cypionate, a very common dose per injection for any purpose, 12 days past this injection 100mg of active testosterone will be left in the body; as another 12 days passes 50mg of active testosterone will be left in the body and so on until no testosterone is left</strong>; this of course does not take into account further injections that may occur but is based on one injection so that understanding may be gained.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>It should be at this stage fairly easy to see the benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate and it doesn’t take a genius to see they are almost everything anyone could ever want out of anabolic steroid use. A common benefit often overlooked is the testosterone hormone’s <strong>ability to increase metabolic activity and in-truth this may be one of the greatest benefits of all and for all users of all purposes</strong>. For the HRT patient it allows him to garner a healthier physique pure and simple. For the performance enhancer it not only allows him to garner a more pleasing physique but one that is more efficient in nature; the higher our metabolic activity the more efficient our body becomes in most all aspects. Of course often the principle reason of supplemental testosterone use is to increase mass, strength and athletic performance and Testosterone-Cypionate will aid in every aspect and do so remarkably well; however, there are important things to understand. If you’re basing your understanding of Testosterone-Cypionate on popular culture references regarding anabolic steroids then all you need to do is grab a bottle, fill a syringe, inject and watch the show start; sorry, it doesn’t quite work this way. If you are after a true performance enhancing edge you still have to feed the body properly with adequate amounts of food and physical stimulation; through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate we simply enhance these aspects and increase the efficiency. For the TRT patient this might be a relief, for many TRT patients are petrified of testosterone therapy because they assume they’ll turn into the Incredible Hulk; if you do not feed and stimulate properly and in adequate amounts you have nothing to fear; further, HRT doses are typically too low to really do anything in this regard even if you do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>When examining the side-effects of Testosterone-Cypionate or any testosterone there is some good news right from the start; as testosterone is not a foreign substance it is not a hormone our bodies are unaccustomed to; you’ve been producing it at some level your entire life. Even so, when we enter into our body anything of an exogenous nature there is a potential for negative side-effects and the level of potential can vary with each and every item. The same can be said of all anabolic androgenic steroids, the level of potential varies with each and every one; nevertheless, while there is potential the probability is much lower than with many common over the counter medications, especially when we look at testosterone. Testosterone in many ways shouldn’t really be viewed as a drug, it doesn’t share any traits with what we use to determine if something is a drug and it’s not, it’s a hormone and there is a big, big difference. For healthy adult men most all will find that Testosterone-Cypionate is very well-tolerated when used responsibly; in-fact, numerous studies including those done by the New England Journal of Medicine have shown that even in supraphysiological doses the testosterone hormone can be used safely and without side-effects. While responsible use will always be best some individuals may find side-effects to occur and such side-effects caused by Testosterone-Cypionate will be of an estrogenic nature. Testosterone converts to estrogen once present in the body due to the aromatase process and by the buildup of estrogen problems such as <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues can occur</strong>. While these can be very problematic many individuals will never have to take note of them while just as many will but fortunately we can easily do something about it. While total dose will play a large role so will individual sensitivity but in either case anti-estrogen medications can prove to be invaluable here; most notably and with the greatest authority aromatase inhibitors (AI’s.) An AI actively inhibits the aromatase process as well as reduces the amount of estrogen in your body; understand what doesn’t exist cannot convert and what cannot convert cannot lead to a negative effect. There is another side-effect we must mention and it is one that will affect every man; testicular atrophy. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids, including testosterone our natural testosterone production is suppressed and as testosterone is produced in the testicles, when this production is in decline the testicles shrink. However, through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate this is of no physical concern as our body is being supplied with all the testosterone it needs. Further, testicular atrophy does not imply shriveled up raisins, it simply means the total mass will be a little less and anyone who has ever supplemented with Testosterone-Cypionate before can tell you it’s really not that big of a deal. Most importantly, when use is discontinued the testicles will return to their normal size; as no exogenous hormones of an anabolic steroidal nature are entering the body natural testosterone production will begin again. However, this will generally prove to be useless information to the TRT patient as he will more than likely be on continuous <strong>testosterone therapy</strong> for the remainder of his life.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate vs. Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>They are the two most commonly used Testosterones in both performance enhancement and TRT and two of the most commonly used anabolic steroids of all kinds the world over; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate. For years, decades even there has been a constant back and forth argument on which one is better and you will find individuals on both sides of the fence who swear up and down they are right; so the question is, which one is it? The answer, neither; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate are almost identical in every single way, so closely related that any difference is of such an insignificant nature that the users could not possibly benefit more or less from one or the other. Look at it like this; you have two sandwiches made by the same person with the same ingredients, one was made right now and the other 32 seconds before; one comes with a pickle on the side; which sandwich is better? To give you a more specific understanding both are pure testosterone, both are attached to large esters and while <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate most commonly comes dosed at 200mg/ml</strong> and<strong>Testosterone-Enanthate most commonly comes dosed at 250mg/ml</strong> the individual can easily adjust the amounts to receive identical dosing with each. The only difference here lies within the half-life of each; recall, Testosterone-Cypionate carries with it a half-life of approximately 12 days while Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it a half-life of approximately 36 hours less; when we’re extending past a week in total half-life with only 36 hours difference this is meaningless. The truth is simple; the same dosing of each testosterone compound will produce identical results.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Regardless of your purpose be it performance enhancement, TRT or a full blown HRT program you will be very hard pressed to find a better testosterone than Testosterone-Cypionate. In the world of TRT most will find 200mg every 7-10 days to be fairly common place and generally speaking about as high as you’ll ever go but of course in performance enhancing doses will necessarily be much higher. For the performance enhancer minimal dosing will generally be in the <strong>400mg-500mg per week</strong> range and most commonly split into two even doses twice per week; for example, for <strong>400mg total per week</strong> you might administer the hormone at 200mg on Monday and 200mg on Thursday continuing such a schedule until your total duration is complete. For many <strong>500mg per week</strong> will be as high as they ever need to go but in more hardcore circles it is not uncommon for doses to reach levels of <strong>1,000mg per week</strong> and at extreme elite levels, especially in competitive bodybuilding they can go much higher. Keep in mind, while the benefits of use will increase as the dose does so will the potential and probability of adverse effects. There is a strong risk to reward ratio at play and in the end you are the only one who can determine how far you want to go with that. Yes, absolutely anabolic steroids and especially those of a pure testosterone nature such as Testosterone-Cypionate can be used safely and effectively but responsible use will always prove to be the ultimate key. Part of responsible use will always include what is known as a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan in order to normalize the body after use has been discontinued. Recall, the use of such hormones as Testosterone-Cypionate will suppress natural testosterone production but natural production will begin again once use is discontinued; however, such production will not begin instantly and there are things we can do to speed up the process. The sooner we get our natural production back up and running the more progress we made through our anabolic steroid use will be kept but most importantly our overall health will be protected; recall yet again, testosterone is essential to our health. This is where a good PCT plan comes in and it is by this plan we can stimulate natural production to begin; common supplemental items often include SERM’s such as Nolvadex andClomid as well as the hormone hCG.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">200 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Testabol Depot (testosterone cypionate) 200 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 08:14:52",1,open,338,,,no,no,,90,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/testabol-depot.jpg ! alt :  ! title : testabol-depot ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/testabol-depot/,24,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Injectable Steroids > Testosterone Cypionate","buy testabol depot",

in-fact, all anabolic androgenicsteroids owe their allegiance to the testosterone hormone, for without it they would not exist. Of all the forms of anabolic steroids it is testosterone that was first and regarding mass productionTestosterone-Propionate was the first to hit the shelves in mass quantity ready for human use. Testosterone-Propionate is one of the longest existing <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> and since its inception and into the present day it has remained one of the most popular of all time. Its popularity stems from many points but first and foremost it remains popular because it is simply pure testosterone, a hormone of great anabolic and androgenic power. Further, as we will shortly see testosterone is one of the more versatile hormones we can ever become acquainted with and while all testosterone forms are simply that, testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate holds a special place in the hearts of many performance enhancers due to its fast acting nature. Regardless of anything else Testosterone-Propionate is the easiest testosterone form to control, it is very easy to maintain stable levels, easy to control in-terms of side-effects and generally one of the more user friendly anabolic androgenic steroids anyone could ever choose. Thankfully the supply of Testosterone-Propionate is also through the roof as every underground lab and every steroidal compounding Pharmacy manufactures this testosterone compound making it one of the more readily available and affordable anabolic steroids.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is a hormone produced by both men and women and is essential to our very functioning existence. As it is responsible for a host of functions we can see the majority of the functions when we examine low levels of the hormone and the negative effects it can cause. As for Testosterone-Propionate, what we have is identical to the testosterone hormone you naturally produced, the only difference being <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> is synthetically manufactured. How important is the testosterone hormone? Largely the examination of low levels can tell us everything we need to know and while low levels in of themselves are not life-threatening they can be beyond problematic and lead to many problems that can be life-threatening indeed; look at it like opening a door that should remained closed. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone and while more men will fall prey many women do as well, will often find symptoms such as increases in body-fat, loss of muscle tissue and strength, the inability to lose body-fat even when dieting and exercising, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction in men, a weakened immune system, lethargy, depression, a lack of mental focus, a lack of clarity of thought; the list goes on and on. Again, directly none of these conditions are life-threatening but you’d be hard pressed to make a positive argument regarding a single one. Further, it’s no secret, excess body-fat and a loss of muscle tissue is well-known to be the gateway to many serious physical problems, many of which are quite life-threatening indeed. An interesting note, in recent year’s low testosterone has also been linked to dementia, most notably regarding fatal Alzheimer’s disease. For the individual who suffers from low levels, when he supplements with testosterone and Testosterone-Propionate can be used for just that, he will in-fact see each and every area that was once found lacking improved upon and to a strong degree this is exactly how we can look at performance enhancing. For the performance enhancer the idea is simple, to take the <strong>levels of testosterone</strong> past what can be produced naturally thereby enhancing the traits and functions for what it is responsible for greatly. It really is that simple and is nowhere nearly as complicated as many like to make it out to be. So how does it all work? By its nature and direct mode of action Testosterone-Propionate as a pure testosterone form greatly increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis. Both of these traits are key factors in building lean tissue as well as preserving it and as lean tissue increases so does our overall metabolic rate. If nothing else this makes the hormone immeasurable in-terms of how truly beneficial it is but as you may have guessed its direct mode of action goes much deeper. Testosterone-Propionate will dramatically reduce and inhibit the release of glucocorticoid hormones in the body. This is important because these are the hormones that destroy muscle tissue and promote the storage of body-fat; while you may not be familiar with all glucocorticoid hormones you’ve probably heard of one, the most famous of all, cortisol. By supplementing and increasing ourtestosterone levels through the use of <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> we now have less cortisol in our body; again, promoting greater metabolic activity. Testosterone also plays a key and vital role along with IGF-1, a naturally produced peptide hormone of immense anabolic power and importance. IGF-1 effects nearly every single cell in the human body and the more testosterone in your system the greater release of this peptide hormone there will be. IGF-1 also play a direct role alongside another peptide hormone, the most famous of all, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and it is the release of IGF-1 that plays a very important role in how much HGH you produce. While this gives you a general understanding of the testosterone hormone you still need to understand the Propionate ester. Propionate is not a steroid, it is not a hormone, it is an ester that can be attached to a hormone and testosterone is not the only one. Propionate is one of the smaller esters we have available, not the smallest but pretty close; of the most common esters used the only smaller ester most will use will be Acetate. As a small ester based testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate will become active and noticeable very quickly and as to be expected will carry a very short half-life; meaning, the total duration of activity is very short lived, thereby making frequent administration necessary. Testosterone-Propionate carries a half-life of approximately 4 days and will need to be administered at least every 3 days with every other day being far more optimal. Further, as more of an interesting note, as the Propionate ester is so small it will take up very little mass in the compound; meaning a larger portion of the compound will be pure testosterone. For example, 100mg of Testosterone-Propionate will yield more usable testosterone than 100mg of a larger ester based form such as Testosterone-Cypionate. In the end, while worthy of note it is of little consequence since dosing can easily be adjusted to receive the same amount with any form.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>As Testosterone-Propionate is just that, testosterone it is for all intense purpose one of the very few perfect anabolic androgenic steroids. Individual goals can greatly vary from treating low testosterone, performance enhancement, bulking, cutting, improving athletic performance or simple vanity and<strong>Testosterone-Propionate</strong> can have a place in each and every one. As is evident from the hormones description above Testosterone-Propionate can greatly add muscle mass, increase strength, improve metabolic efficiency, improve athletic performance and grant you a greater sense of well-being; is there really much more you could want? Further, because Testosterone-Propionate is such a fast acting anabolic steroid, while most will tolerate it very well if you are one of the few who does not for whatever reason, simply discontinuing use will be very simple as the hormone will clear in just a few days. By-and-large the simplest way to look at the benefits are as we discussed above; when we understand what testosterone is responsible for we then understand why it’s important to make sure levels are adequate if they are lacking. Further, regarding performance enhancement when we understand again what the hormone is responsible for we understand very easily how increasing our levels increases its efficiency by in-which it functions, we literally enhance the performance of the testosterone hormone.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them possible side-effects and as Testosterone-Propionate is an anabolic androgenic steroid it too carries with it possible <strong>side-effects</strong>. However, it is very important to remember testosterone is not akin to taking medicine; although steroids are often labeled “Drugs” such a label is somewhat haphazard. As you recall, testosterone is a hormone you naturally produce and have so your entire life and by basic logic the presence of testosterone will generally be very well tolerated. Even so, when we present to our body anything in exogenous form there is always some level of risk; how great the risk varies from each and every item and in the world of anabolic steroids the level of risk varies with each and every one. In the case of Testosterone-Propionate, as it is very well-tolerated in most healthy adult men most will not have any problems; however, responsible use will always be the safest route to follow. Of course it must be noted, “responsible use” can mean quite a few different things to different people but nevertheless, there are facts and there are real life experiences we can pull from to gauge our choices. Of the possible side-effects you will find they most commonly include <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and issues of a cholesterol nature as well as testicular atrophy</strong>; testicular atrophy being the one guaranteed side-effect in all men. Testicular atrophy occurs for one simple reason; the presence of anabolic androgenic steroids, even testosterone suppresses natural testosterone production. As testosterone is produced in the testicles and production comes to a halt the testicles simply shrink in size; no, contrary to popular belief they do not shrink to where you can barely see them, we’re speaking of a slight decline is fullness. Once use is discontinued your testicles will return to their normal size as natural testosterone production will begin yet again. As for the other side-effects, they are by no means guaranteed but if they do occur they will do so because of the testosterone conversion process. Testosterone converts into estrogen via the aromatase process and as excess estrogen builds up such related side-effects can become problematic. Absolutely, the total dose of Testosterone-Propionate you take will play a big role; the more testosterone in your system the more testosterone there is to convert into estrogen. Individual sensitivity will also play a large role but there are things we can do if we are sensitive or as simple precautionary measures and none is better than supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor (AI.) An AI inhibits the conversion to estrogen and further reduces the amount of estrogen in the body; as the brunt of potential side-effects are brought on by estrogen you an easily see how and why this can be so beneficial.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Misconception:</h3><p>Go to any steroid related message board and you’ll find individuals who claim Testosterone-Propionate is better suited for cutting cycles and that longer ester based testosterones should be used when bulking; the point, do not listen to these people. Testosterone-Propionate can be used for any cycle, as can pretty much any testosterone form; Testosterone-Propionate is a perfect steroid because <strong>it is pure testosterone and it is not the ester that deems it better for one purpose or the othe</strong>r. It is true, some people will hold a little less water when they use this small ester version but in most cases any water problems can be controlled with diet and the use of AI’s. As for bulking, again, as this is pure testosterone and testosterone is the best agent for a bulking cycle Testosterone-Propionate can be perfect. Yes, you’ll need to inject frequently regardless of the end goal but sometimes this isn’t really a bad thing. Frequent injections of small ester based anabolics are often much easier to control in-terms of maintaining stable and peaked levels of a particular hormone. In the end, when making your choice you’ll find Testosterone-Propionate to be a fine one regardless of anything else but other forms can be just as good.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For the Testosterone Replacement Therapy candidate generally dosing will fall in the <strong>100mg-200mg per week</strong> range and rarely surpassing this amount. However, as frequent injections are necessary most physicians will generally opt for larger ester forms, most commonly Testosterone-Cypionate so the patient only has to inject once per week. For the performance enhancer the dosing will be much larger and the varying levels will be much wider too but he must necessarily inject frequently as discussed if he is going to maintain stability. Generally the minimal dose when supplementing for performance purposes will be 100mg every other day with <strong>200mg every other day</strong> being as high as most will ever go. Yes, you an absolutely take more, there is no set in stone amount but understand such high-end doses can open up the doors to side-effects that you may have wished to remain shut. In elite level competitive sports, especially in elite level bodybuilding it is not uncommon to see doses surpass a 2,000mg per week range but this can be very harsh and there is simply no way such a dosing could ever be recommended in a responsible manner. As with all cycles, as natural testosterone production will be suppressed, once use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) is a must in order to aid and speed up the recovery process. This is where Testosterone-Propionate has a bit of advantage over many other forms of testosterone; as a small ester that clears very quickly if your cycle ends with Testosterone-Propionate and there is no other long ester gear present in your system your PCT plan can start almost immediately. Remember, the sooner we start our PCT the better off we’ll be and such rapid PCT application cannot be accomplished with long ester based testosterone. If your cycle ends with Testosterone-Propionate you could reasonably wait 3 days before PCT therapy begins; if it ends with large ester gear you will need to wait approximately 2 weeks.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Testabol Propionate (testosterone propionate), 100 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon (Thailand)</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 08:17:28",1,open,340,,,no,no,,85,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/testabol-propionate.jpg ! alt :  ! title : testabol-propionate ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/testabol-propionate/,5,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids|Injectable Steroids > Testosterone Propionate","buy testabol propionate",

Drostanolone is a derivative of dihydrotestosterone, most specifically 2alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone. As a result, the structure of this steroid is that of a moderate anabolic/potent androgen which does not aromatize to estrogen. Water retention and gynecomastia are therefore not a concern with this compound; as of course here estrogen is usually the culprit. Masteron may in fact exhibit antiestrogenic activity in the body, competing with other substrates for binding to aromatase. This would reduce the conversion rate of other steroids, Masteron acting in the same manner as the oral steroid Proviron. Bodybuilders have a strong appreciation for non-aromatizing androgens, and find Masteron very useful as a cutting agent. It is likewise generally used a number of weeks prior to a competition, in an effort to bring out an improved look of density and hardness to the muscles. For this purpose Masteron should work exceptionally well so long as the body fat percentage is low enough. Provided everything fits as if should, the user can achieve that ""ripped"" look so popular to professional bodybuilding. The androgenic effect can also be crucial during this period, a time when caloric intake is drastically lowered. The user is provided added ""kick"" or ""drive"" to push through the grueling training sessions leading up to the show. Drostanoione was once also popular with athletes subject to drug testing, as for a period of time this compound was not screened for during competition. The urinary metabolites of drostanoione were recognized by the early 90's however, and this drug now adjoins a long list of anabolic/androgenic steroids identifiable during urinalysis testing. Although some bodybuilders claim they can safely use Masteron if discontinued three to four weeks before a test, there are always uncertainties with the use of esterified injectable steroids. This perhaps makes the oral DHT Proviron (1-ethyldihydrotestosterone) a slightly better choice, as orals offer much better control. Recreational users might also be interested in Masteron. Although dihydrotestosterone is not highly active in muscle tissue, the 2 alkylation present on drostanoione considerably intensifies its anabolic effect. It can therefore be used somewhat effectively as bulking agent, providing a consistent gain of high quality muscle mass. It can also be successfully combined with other steroids for an enhanced effect. Mixing drostanoione with an injectable anabolic such as Deca-Durabolin (nandroione decanoate) or Equipoise (boldenone undecylenate) can prove quite useful for example, the two providing notably enhanced muscle gain without excessive water retention. For greater mass gains, one can alternately addition a stronger androgen such as Dianabol or an injectable testosterone. The result here can be an extreme muscle gain, with a lower level of water retention &amp; other estrogenic side effects than if these steroids were used alone (usually in higher doses). Masteron could of course be used during cutting phases of training as well. A cycle of this drug combined with Winstrol, Primobolan or Cxandrolone should provide great muscle retention and fat loss, during a period which can be very catabolic without steroids. It is an added benefit that none of these steroids aromatize, and therefore there is no additional worry of unwanted water/fat retention. The propionate ester used with this compound will extend its activity for only a few days. With such a short duration of effect, injections need to be repeated at least every 3 or 4 days in order to maintain a consistent level of hormone in the blood. Factoring this in with its low strength (50 mg/ml), men will generally inject a full 2 ml ampule of Masteron (100 mg) every two or three days. The weekly dosage therefore lands in the range of 200-350 mg, a level more than sufficient to receive good results. We also should mention that while some women do profess to using this item before a show, it is much too androgenic in nature to recommend. Virilization symptoms can result quickly with its use, making Masteron a very risky item to experiment with. If attempted, the dosage should be limited to no more than 25 to 50 mg each week. The female athlete would be further served by increasing the number of days between injections to prevent buildup of steroid in the body. In this case, Masteron can perhaps be administered once every 7 days. Since estrogen offers us no trouble, side effects are generally mild with this steroid. As discussed earlier, gynecomastia and water retention go unseen. So are problems controlling blood pressure, again usually associated with estrogen. Masteron is also not liver toxic, so there is little concern stress will be placed on this organ, even during longer cycles. The only prominent side effects stem from the basic androgenic properties of dihydrotestosterone. This includes oily skin, acne, body/facial hair growth, aggression and accelerated hair loss. Since this compound is already a synthetic DHT, Proscar would have no impact on the level of androgenic effects. Men with a receding hairline (or those with a known familial predisposition for baldness) may therefore wish to stay away from Masteron completely, as the potent androgenic effect of this steroid can easily exacerbate such a condition.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Mastabol 100 (drostanolone propionate), 100 mg/ml (10 ml) by British Dragon</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 08:21:37",1,open,342,,,no,no,,85,,,,,,,,instock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mastabol-100.jpg ! alt :  ! title : mastabol-100 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/mastabol-100/,28,,,,,,,,,,,simple,,"British Dragon|Injectable Steroids > Drostanolone Propionate|Injectable Steroids",,

The premise was simple; provide a testosterone based compound that would only need to be administered once every few weeks by combining multiple esters into one single compound for a steady continuous release of the testosterone hormone and the premise proved to be successful. The compound was so successful the individual could effectively inject the hormonal compound only once every 3-4 weeks and maintain a release of testosterone into the system but while a success it was not as perfect as it was hoped to be. Sustanon-250 is simply testosterone, in the same light of Testosterone-Cypionate, Testosterone-Propionate or any other form you can think of; <strong>Sustanon-250</strong> is simply testosterone. In Sustanon-250 what you have is a testosterone mixture, four different esters attached to the same hormone; this does not change the hormones nature, it is just as anabolic and androgenic as it would be with only one ester attached but it’s mode of action in-terms of time regarding both initial activity and total duration is a very different story. While <strong>Sustanon-250</strong> will provide a steady release of testosterone for extended periods of time by injecting only once every few weeks it is very difficult if not impossible to maintain a stable testosterone level and this can be very important to the performance enhancer and should be worthy of understanding to the TRT patient as well. Even though far extended spaced out injections may not be the best course of action as was once thought there is no doubt about it, Sustanon-250 is a fine testosterone hormone and can get the job done regardless of your individual purpose.</p><h3>Sustanon-250:</h3><p>As a four part testosterone Sustanon-250 is comprised of Testosterone-Propionate, Testosterone-Phenylpropionate, Testosterone-Isocaproate and Testosterone-Decanoate in very specific amounts of each comprising of one total 250mg/ml testosterone compound. When you find Sustanon-250, while this is the original Organon trade name you will find many brands carry this title as well or at least a very similar one but regardless the total mixture should look exactly as follows:</p><ul><li>Testosterone-Propionate: 30mg</li><li>Testosterone-Phenylpropionate: 60mg</li><li>Testosterone-Isocaproate: 60mg</li><li>Testosterone-Decanoate: 100mg</li></ul><p>To understand the Sustanon-250 compound we only need to understand two specific things; the testosterone hormone itself and how the esters attached affect it; as you understand testosterone in of itself is the same across the board, it is the esters that vary. In that light, as a four part mixture the design is intended to provide active testosterone in a very quick fashion, as is allowed by the attached <strong>Propionate</strong> and <strong>Phenylpropionate</strong> esters and to continue the duration of release for a far extending period of time through the following two longer esters; Decanoate being the longest of all. Because of the mixtures variation the user will enjoy an almost instant benefit and one that stretches into a total 18 day half-life in total activity; however, as we will see, although a very long total half-life we cannot view this in the traditional half-life sense of other testosterone forms and frequent injections will often prove to be very necessary. As for the direct mode of action regarding the properties of Sustanon-250 the individual will find them to be the same as all testosterone forms, as Sustanon-250 is just that; pure testosterone. As pure testosterone <em>Sustanon-250</em> is highly anabolic and androgenic, equal on both parts. By its nature as a pure testosterone it will greatly enhance nitrogen retention and overall protein synthesis as well as increase red blood cell count; all very important and intrinsic qualities regarding total anabolic activity. Testosterone also greatly affects the release of the anabolic IGF-1 hormone, therefor whentestosterone levels increase more anabolic activity is brought to the table. Further, testosterone has a very positive effect on muscle wasting hormones such as cortisol; cortisol buildup and release is actually inhibited when testosterone is present in adequate amounts, thereby leading to a higher level of total anabolic activity and promoting a physique more apt to building muscle and simply looking and feeling better.</p><h3>The Benefits of Sustanon-250:</h3><p>The single most important benefit of Sustanon-250 revolves around the purpose of its original intent; to provide long standing yet steady release of the testosterone hormone in order to limit administration frequency. For the TRT patient this can be quite convenient but in recent years it has fallen out of popularity as it is very hard to maintain a peaked level of the hormone and most physicians will end up prescribing single ester based testosterones such as the Enanthate or Cypionate version, with Testosterone-Cypionate being very common for <strong>TRT in the U.S</strong>. For the performance enhancer this time released quality will however prove to be of very little use, for this individual must inject the hormone at a minimum of every three days if he is to maintain not only stable levels of testosterone but peaked and stable levels. As you understand the hormone you can easily determine how injection frequency will best serve you and once this is determined you can easily bring forth the therapeutic needs you desire. For the TRT patient who suffers from low testosterone he will see on the benefits for which testosterone is responsible for improve; this includes muscle mass and strength, sexual function including desire and erectile function, overall metabolic activity, energy, immune function and even your general sense of well-being. For the performance enhancer the same can be said, simply to a stronger degree. For the performance enhancer Sustanon-250 can be the perfect steroid for any cycle as it will aid in building mass and strength but will also aid in the leaning out process by way of preserving muscle tissue when on a calorie restricted diet and even improving the rate in-which body-fat is lost in the first place leading to an more impressive physique as well as a more functional one.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Sustanon-250:</h3><p>If it’s an anabolic androgenic steroid it will carry with it the possibility of negative side-effects and as Sustanon-250 is pure testosterone and as testosterone is the father of all anabolic androgenic steroids, you bet, it carries with it possible side-effects. However, it is also important to keep in mind when speaking of testosterone we are speaking of a hormone we naturally produce, we are not speaking of a foreign substance our body is unfamiliar with; in-fact, while there are possible <strong>side-effects</strong> you’ll find many over the counter medications commonly carry with them the possibility of far worse side-effects than testosterone and a far greater probability. That is correct, probability plays a role and with responsible use of Sustanon-250 or any testosterone and for that matter most anabolic steroids, side-effects can easily be avoided or at least easily controlled. As for the actual side-effects themselves, they will be the same as all testosterone forms, as the testosterone hormone aromatizes greatly and by this aromatase process converts to estrogen. As this conversion occurs and estrogen levels increase such estrogenic related side-effects can occur including Gynecomastia, excess water retention, high blood pressure and issues of a cholesterol nature. These side-effects can be very easily controlled and some will need no method of control as their response will be so positive no negative effect will be found. For those who do experience a buildup of estrogen an good aromatase inhibitor (AI) is highly advised as by the use of an AI you will inhibit the aromatase process from occurring as well as reduce the amount of estrogen in your body; what doesn’t exist cannot cause a problem. One’s diet will also play a large role and to maintain a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels it’s always a good idea to follow a diet rich in healthy fats, particularly omega fatty acids. There is however another side-effect to Sustanon-250 use and it is and will occur with all testosterone and all anabolic steroids for that matter; testicular atrophy.

Testosterone-Enanthate is one of the most versatile anabolic androgenic steroids one could ever use as it is for all intense purposes the perfect steroid for almost any purpose. Highly anabolic and androgenic in nature, with a rating of 100 in each, as are all testosterone forms, as the demand for this hormone is very high as is the supply you will find Testosterone-Enanthate to be one of the more easily affordable anabolic steroids on the market. From bodybuilders to power lifters, to on the field athletes and gym rats and everything in-between if you find an individual who has supplemented with anabolic steroids before and in the U.S. you’ll find over six-million who do so simply for cosmetic purposes then you’ll find a strong majority have supplemented with Testosterone-Enanthate.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>To understand Testosterone-Enanthate we only need to understand two things; the testosterone hormone and the Enanthate ester. In-fact, when we understand the testosterone hormone we will largely understand each and every form of exogenous testosterone as the hormone itself is identically the same in all types. The ester, in this case Enanthate is not a hormone, the ester does not provide any physical benefit that you desire to obtain. The ester does play an important role when attached to a testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid and the ester attached can vary greatly; however, in short, the ester is what largely determines the hormones initial and total activity and you will generally find that to be the only point of interest in its regards. While it should be clear it bears worth repeating; testosterone is simply testosterone, the form does not change the hormone; Testosterone-Enanthate, Testosterone-Propionate, mixtures such as Sustanon-250 or Omnadren, they are all comprised of the same active testosterone hormone; only the ester(s) are different, only the esters vary but the testosterone hormone remains the same. For years testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids in general have received a lot of bad press in popular culture, much of it based on a simple lack of education but as we understand the world isn’t flat we also understand many things about the testosterone hormone. Testosterone is a hormone naturally produced by both men and women; regardless of your thoughts and opinions on anabolic steroids you produce testosterone whether you like it or not. Individual production can vary greatly from one person to the next, there is no standard amount but men will generally produce ten times the amount as women but it remains essential to health and function for both sexes. In-fact, the testosterone hormone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce; without the hormone we cannot function properly and in the way a human being was intended to. Testosterone is responsible for many functions and aspects of the human body including those of both a physical and mental nature and when levels fall below an optimal range the individual can suffer greatly. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone levels commonly do so because of age. As we age our natural testosterone production declines, this is especially true for men but in many cases for post-menopausal women as well. Individuals who suffer will find such issues as loss in strength and muscle tissue, increases of excess body-fat, lethargy, depression, decreased libido, an inability to perform sexually, a weakened immune system to a host of other issues; does testosterone sound a little important yet? For the individual who suffers from low levels of testosterone remedy is easily available and often <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> can be the answer to this call, as Testosterone-Enanthate is just that, pure testosterone. Of course for the performance enhancer improving low levels is not really the goal; for the performance enhancer the idea is to surpass normal levels so as to enhance the attributes the hormone carries. Regardless of the purpose of use, be it performance enhancement or TRT the mode of action within the hormone remains the same. By its very nature as a pure testosterone, Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it many traits from increasing nitrogen retention and protein synthesis, thereby promoting tissue growth and regeneration and of equal importance preservation. That alone is enough to make testosterone extremely valuable but it hardly ends there. The testosterone hormone is also responsible for many metabolic traits and a large portion of our overall metabolic activity; and while the above plays an intrinsic role it is only a scratching the surface. Through the use of supplemental Testosterone-Enanthate we increase our testosterone levels enabling the hormone to perform a much needed action in inhibiting the release as well as reducing the amount of stress hormones we have in the body; more specifically glucocorticoid hormones. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly referred to as muscle wasting hormones as they destroy muscle tissue and greatly promote increases in excess body-fat. If that’s not enough the direct mode of action of the testosterone hormone continues to gain in power and importance but as you can see the importance is already there. When we supplement with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em>, especially in doses beyond therapeutic measure we greatly increase the amount of IGF-1 released into the body. IGF-1 is another very powerful yet naturally produced anabolic hormone and is so essential to health and function that it affects almost every single cell within the human body. As you now have a good understanding of the function and purpose of the testosterone hormone you can now begin to understand how the ester affects it and as we are only concerned with Testosterone-Enanthate it is the Enanthate ester we will look at and how it works when attached. Testosterone-Enanthate is a slow acting yet long lasting in effect testosterone form. This time factor is created by the Enanthate ester that is attached and as the Enanthate ester is fairly large so is its total half-life. The half-life of Testosterone-Enanthate is approximately 10.5 days and that is a fairly decently long half-life; in-fact, the only single ester based testosterone most will use that has a longer half-life is Testosterone-Cypionate and its half-life is only about 36 hours longer. As a large ester based anabolic steroid Testosterone-Enanthate will not require frequent injections. For the TRT patient generally one injection every week will be sufficient while most performance enhancers will find two injections of equal dosing per week to be just about perfect. Most performance enhancers will choose to inject on the same two days each week, for example, Monday and Thursday and the same can be said of the TRT patient, on the same day each week and you are advised to do the same.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>If you suffer from low testosterone, in most cases Testosterone-Enanthate will provide you with every last benefit you could ever need or desire. For the performance enhancer the exact same thing can be said; in-fact, Testosterone-Enanthate will provide almost every benefit an anabolic steroid can bring, for as you recall it is one of the most versatile hormones of all. Through the use of Testosterone-Enanthate and the increased levels of testosterone now in the body we have created the perfect playing field that will lend to the promotion of mass and strength and not just mass but quality muscle tissue. Further, as it is responsible for a large portion of total metabolic activity our overall metabolic efficiency is enhanced, allowing us to lose excess body-fat more effectively or build more lean tissue if we so desire without the excess addition of body-fat that often accompany it. Of equal importance Testosterone-Enanthate will greatly improve our recovery capabilities and for the athlete this is of great importance, for it is in the recovery process that progress is made; weight training and physical stimulation is just that but it is the recovery from such events that causes the body to regenerate to a stronger degree; with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em> we are able to enhance this factor. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone there may be parts of this that sound very distasteful; after all, the majority of people have no desire to build a lot of muscle, they do not desire a freaky look and for you there’s good news; supplementing with Testosterone-Enanthate will not provide this on its own, therefore you have nothing to fear. Yes, Testosterone-Enanthate can greatly aid in this purpose if you so desire but you must do other things as well in-order to meet this end. More importantly, when we speak of increasing muscle mass somehow in popular culture this has been deemed only as “massive piles” and as a negative attribute when nothing could be further from the truth. You need some level of muscle tissue on your frame in-order to simply function, further, lean muscle mass greatly affects your metabolism; how much of it you have is largely up to you but too little is never a good thing. In short, to be big you have to eat big, you have to train big but the intake of food plays the biggest role of all. If you have no desire to have a bodybuilding type physique then simply don’t eat like a bodybuilder and even then you shouldn’t really expect one outright; after all, you’d never say “I want to play golf but I don’t want to be as good as Tiger Woods” of course not, that is ridiculous for numerous reasons. Testosterone-Enanthate also presents to us another very useful benefit and it remains so regardless of the testosterone form being used; the preservation of muscle tissue. When we diet in-order to lose excess body-fat some muscle mass is going to be lost but as mentioned the more muscle mass we possess the greater our metabolic activity. Fortunately testosterone protects and preserves lean tissue, especially when calories are low and fat is being burned. Not only is muscle tissue protected but as our metabolism is also being improved in general we thereby have a more pleasing physique looking back at us in the mirror.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>As exogenous testosterone is one of the most highly well-tolerated hormones any man can ever supplement with the probability of adverse side-effects is fairly low when use is done in a responsible manner. However, testosterone is so well-tolerated that even in supraphysiological doses it can be used without a negative effect; this is such an important piece of information we must delve into it in its own section later on. While use can be very safe there are potential <strong>side-effects</strong> we must be aware of and as Testosterone-Enanthate is simply pure testosterone the potential side-effects will largely be of an estrogenic nature. When testosterone is present in the body it inevitably converts to estrogen via the aromatase process. Through this conversion some of the most commonly well-known anabolic steroid related side-effects can occur including Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues. While there is no way to predict if you will fall prey it is always important to remember total dosing can play a large role; after all, if there’s more testosterone to convert into estrogen the larger the potential buildup is. For those who are sensitive to such effects anti-estrogen medications can often be their saving grace and there are none better than aromatase inhibitors (AI’s) such as Arimidex and Letrozole. AI’s do exactly what their name implies, inhibit the aromatase process; that is correct, they stop the conversion process but they have also been shown to actually reduce the total amount of estrogen in the body as well. It is true, while the use of an AI will in most cases keep an individual free and clear of such effects in a small minority it will not but in most cases if you examine your diet, ensure it is rich in omega fatty acids, ensure your carbohydrate consumption isn’t above need, ensure dosing is adequate but not too high you will normally be absolutely fine. While Testosterone-Enanthate is generally well-tolerated there is one side-effect assured to occur in all men and it is that of testicular atrophy; however, as horrific as it might sound we cannot aptly label it an adverse effect. When we supplement with exogenous testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid our natural <strong>testosterone levels</strong> are suppressed, production is reduced and our testicles shrink. No, our testicles do not shrink into thin air, they simply lose some of their fullness but it is only temporary. Once all anabolic steroid use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks, natural production will begin again and the testicles will return to their normal size. Further, while exogenous hormones are being used and natural production is suppressed, if we are using Testosterone-Enanthate we have no chance in suffering from low level symptoms because we are providing our body and in many cases more testosterone than it already needs for proper health and function. It must be noted, for the TRT patient as he will likely remain on therapy the rest of his life there will be no breaks and testicular atrophy will remain.</p><h3>The New England Journal of Medicine:</h3><p>You’ve heard the stories; steroids will kill you, steroids will turn you into a raging lunatic, steroids will rot your brain, explode your heart and everything in-between and if you ask anyone with half a brain none of this sounds like too much fun. Even so, the question remains, is it the truth? We know from a simple look at statistics that there has never been a death directly caused by anabolic androgenic steroids and we have seen evidence that destroys many of the supposed health concerns time and time again but none is more telling than the 1996 study done by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) titled “The Effects of Supraphysiological Doses of Testosterone on Muscle Size and Strength in Normal Men.” To this day it is one of the more thorough studies regarding <strong>anabolic steroid</strong> use, one done not only in a controlled manner but without emotional bias; only the facts are present. More importantly the term “Supraphysiological” refers to doses beyond therapeutic; that’s right, in the case of the NEJM study we’re talking about performance enhancement. While you can find the full study on the NEJM website a brief overview and summary will give you a good understanding. 40 men ages 19-49 were placed in four groups of ten. None of the men had ever supplemented with anabolic androgenic steroids or used any recreational drug and each man was free from any psychiatric or behavioral disorder. All 40 men were of reasonable good health and broken down into the four following categories:</p><ul><li>Group One: Placebo with no exercise</li><li>Group Two: Testosterone with no exercise</li><li>Group Three: Placebo with exercise</li><li>Group Four: Testosterone with exercise</li></ul><p>Each man was instructed to follow a diet based on standardized RDA requirements and such diets were monitored closely for several weeks until the actual testing began. In the test the men not given testosterone is a simple result, they were given no testosterone and are of little concern here; however, you can again see the full results of the study on the NEJM website but here we are only concerned with the 20 men who actually received <strong>testosterone injections</strong>. Of the 20 men each received 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for a total of 10 weeks; keep in mind, 600mg per week is generally three times the amount of the standard highest therapeutic dose given to most patients who suffer from low testosterone; again, this is very much a performance level dosing. Of the 20 men who received the Testosterone-Enanthate the physical results of a positive nature were akin to the benefits we have explained here; increases in strength, muscle tissue, decreases in body-fat, etc. While that’s all well and fine what most people want to know about is the side-effects and this is where things get interesting; after all, it’s no secret that anabolic steroids work. In the study, of the 20 men who were given 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for 10 weeks no one died, no one had a heart attack and no one had a stroke; but what about the specific health effects?</p><ul><li>“The serum liver-enzyme concentrations, hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrits, and red-cell counts did not change in any study group”</li><li>“Plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides did not change in any study group”</li><li>“There was no change in the serum concentration of prostate-specific antigen in any group”</li><li>“No significant changes in mood or behavior were reported by the men on the Mood Inventory or by their live-in partners, spouses, or parents on the Observer Mood Inventory”</li></ul><p>The results of the test speak for themselves.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Be it for the purpose of performance enhancing, bulking or cutting, be it for the purpose of treating low testosterone you will be hard pressed to find anything better than pure testosterone and luckily for you that’s exactly what Testosterone-Enanthate is. For the performance enhancer generally 500mg per week of <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> is a good standard dose, especially for a beginner but for many seasoned veterans as well. 500mg per week can be used very safely and with very good results and is an excellent foundation for any anabolic steroid stack; in-fact, regardless of your dose testosterone in general is always the best foundational stone. While 500mg is a quality amount that will do more for you than you could ever hope for without, many will supplement with more and doses upwards of 1,000mg per week are not uncommon among the veteran hardcore. While there is no way we can recommend such doses outright many seem to be fine with them but long-term evidence and studies are lacking in this regard to say with any assured certainty. Further, as we have explained, when doses increase so does the probability of negative effects so if you choose to supplement this high you must proceed with extra caution. For the average man even in a hardcore sense 1,000mg per week is about as high as he’ll ever go, in the elite level, especially in competitive bodybuilding doses can get much higher but some level of an adverse reaction is almost guaranteed when it does. Remember, responsible use will always be your best friend and responsible use will include periods of discontinuing use and will be accompanied by a quality <strong>Post Cycle Therapy</strong> (PCT) plan. A PCT plan is designed not only to aid in normalizing your body but further to stimulate the production of the essential testosterone hormone. While no PCT will in its own right bring production back to 100% it will send you on your way to just that much faster than without and the sooner this can be achieved the healthier you’ll be as well as more of your progress will be maintained. A quality PCT will always include a quality SERM such as Nolvadex or Clomid and often will include the greatly beneficial hCGhormone.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/amp.

Testosterone-Enanthate is one of the most versatile anabolic androgenic steroids one could ever use as it is for all intense purposes the perfect steroid for almost any purpose. Highly anabolic and androgenic in nature, with a rating of 100 in each, as are all testosterone forms, as the demand for this hormone is very high as is the supply you will find Testosterone-Enanthate to be one of the more easily affordable anabolic steroids on the market. From bodybuilders to power lifters, to on the field athletes and gym rats and everything in-between if you find an individual who has supplemented with anabolic steroids before and in the U.S. you’ll find over six-million who do so simply for cosmetic purposes then you’ll find a strong majority have supplemented with Testosterone-Enanthate.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>To understand Testosterone-Enanthate we only need to understand two things; the testosterone hormone and the Enanthate ester. In-fact, when we understand the testosterone hormone we will largely understand each and every form of exogenous testosterone as the hormone itself is identically the same in all types. The ester, in this case Enanthate is not a hormone, the ester does not provide any physical benefit that you desire to obtain. The ester does play an important role when attached to a testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid and the ester attached can vary greatly; however, in short, the ester is what largely determines the hormones initial and total activity and you will generally find that to be the only point of interest in its regards. While it should be clear it bears worth repeating; testosterone is simply testosterone, the form does not change the hormone; Testosterone-Enanthate, Testosterone-Propionate, mixtures such as Sustanon-250 or Omnadren, they are all comprised of the same active testosterone hormone; only the ester(s) are different, only the esters vary but the testosterone hormone remains the same. For years testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids in general have received a lot of bad press in popular culture, much of it based on a simple lack of education but as we understand the world isn’t flat we also understand many things about the testosterone hormone. Testosterone is a hormone naturally produced by both men and women; regardless of your thoughts and opinions on anabolic steroids you produce testosterone whether you like it or not. Individual production can vary greatly from one person to the next, there is no standard amount but men will generally produce ten times the amount as women but it remains essential to health and function for both sexes. In-fact, the testosterone hormone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce; without the hormone we cannot function properly and in the way a human being was intended to. Testosterone is responsible for many functions and aspects of the human body including those of both a physical and mental nature and when levels fall below an optimal range the individual can suffer greatly. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone levels commonly do so because of age. As we age our natural testosterone production declines, this is especially true for men but in many cases for post-menopausal women as well. Individuals who suffer will find such issues as loss in strength and muscle tissue, increases of excess body-fat, lethargy, depression, decreased libido, an inability to perform sexually, a weakened immune system to a host of other issues; does testosterone sound a little important yet? For the individual who suffers from low levels of testosterone remedy is easily available and often <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> can be the answer to this call, as Testosterone-Enanthate is just that, pure testosterone. Of course for the performance enhancer improving low levels is not really the goal; for the performance enhancer the idea is to surpass normal levels so as to enhance the attributes the hormone carries. Regardless of the purpose of use, be it performance enhancement or TRT the mode of action within the hormone remains the same. By its very nature as a pure testosterone, Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it many traits from increasing nitrogen retention and protein synthesis, thereby promoting tissue growth and regeneration and of equal importance preservation. That alone is enough to make testosterone extremely valuable but it hardly ends there. The testosterone hormone is also responsible for many metabolic traits and a large portion of our overall metabolic activity; and while the above plays an intrinsic role it is only a scratching the surface. Through the use of supplemental Testosterone-Enanthate we increase our testosterone levels enabling the hormone to perform a much needed action in inhibiting the release as well as reducing the amount of stress hormones we have in the body; more specifically glucocorticoid hormones. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly referred to as muscle wasting hormones as they destroy muscle tissue and greatly promote increases in excess body-fat. If that’s not enough the direct mode of action of the testosterone hormone continues to gain in power and importance but as you can see the importance is already there. When we supplement with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em>, especially in doses beyond therapeutic measure we greatly increase the amount of IGF-1 released into the body. IGF-1 is another very powerful yet naturally produced anabolic hormone and is so essential to health and function that it affects almost every single cell within the human body. As you now have a good understanding of the function and purpose of the testosterone hormone you can now begin to understand how the ester affects it and as we are only concerned with Testosterone-Enanthate it is the Enanthate ester we will look at and how it works when attached. Testosterone-Enanthate is a slow acting yet long lasting in effect testosterone form. This time factor is created by the Enanthate ester that is attached and as the Enanthate ester is fairly large so is its total half-life. The half-life of Testosterone-Enanthate is approximately 10.5 days and that is a fairly decently long half-life; in-fact, the only single ester based testosterone most will use that has a longer half-life is Testosterone-Cypionate and its half-life is only about 36 hours longer. As a large ester based anabolic steroid Testosterone-Enanthate will not require frequent injections. For the TRT patient generally one injection every week will be sufficient while most performance enhancers will find two injections of equal dosing per week to be just about perfect. Most performance enhancers will choose to inject on the same two days each week, for example, Monday and Thursday and the same can be said of the TRT patient, on the same day each week and you are advised to do the same.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>If you suffer from low testosterone, in most cases Testosterone-Enanthate will provide you with every last benefit you could ever need or desire. For the performance enhancer the exact same thing can be said; in-fact, Testosterone-Enanthate will provide almost every benefit an anabolic steroid can bring, for as you recall it is one of the most versatile hormones of all. Through the use of Testosterone-Enanthate and the increased levels of testosterone now in the body we have created the perfect playing field that will lend to the promotion of mass and strength and not just mass but quality muscle tissue. Further, as it is responsible for a large portion of total metabolic activity our overall metabolic efficiency is enhanced, allowing us to lose excess body-fat more effectively or build more lean tissue if we so desire without the excess addition of body-fat that often accompany it. Of equal importance Testosterone-Enanthate will greatly improve our recovery capabilities and for the athlete this is of great importance, for it is in the recovery process that progress is made; weight training and physical stimulation is just that but it is the recovery from such events that causes the body to regenerate to a stronger degree; with <em>Testosterone-Enanthate</em> we are able to enhance this factor. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone there may be parts of this that sound very distasteful; after all, the majority of people have no desire to build a lot of muscle, they do not desire a freaky look and for you there’s good news; supplementing with Testosterone-Enanthate will not provide this on its own, therefore you have nothing to fear. Yes, Testosterone-Enanthate can greatly aid in this purpose if you so desire but you must do other things as well in-order to meet this end. More importantly, when we speak of increasing muscle mass somehow in popular culture this has been deemed only as “massive piles” and as a negative attribute when nothing could be further from the truth. You need some level of muscle tissue on your frame in-order to simply function, further, lean muscle mass greatly affects your metabolism; how much of it you have is largely up to you but too little is never a good thing. In short, to be big you have to eat big, you have to train big but the intake of food plays the biggest role of all. If you have no desire to have a bodybuilding type physique then simply don’t eat like a bodybuilder and even then you shouldn’t really expect one outright; after all, you’d never say “I want to play golf but I don’t want to be as good as Tiger Woods” of course not, that is ridiculous for numerous reasons. Testosterone-Enanthate also presents to us another very useful benefit and it remains so regardless of the testosterone form being used; the preservation of muscle tissue. When we diet in-order to lose excess body-fat some muscle mass is going to be lost but as mentioned the more muscle mass we possess the greater our metabolic activity. Fortunately testosterone protects and preserves lean tissue, especially when calories are low and fat is being burned. Not only is muscle tissue protected but as our metabolism is also being improved in general we thereby have a more pleasing physique looking back at us in the mirror.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>As exogenous testosterone is one of the most highly well-tolerated hormones any man can ever supplement with the probability of adverse side-effects is fairly low when use is done in a responsible manner. However, testosterone is so well-tolerated that even in supraphysiological doses it can be used without a negative effect; this is such an important piece of information we must delve into it in its own section later on. While use can be very safe there are potential <strong>side-effects</strong> we must be aware of and as Testosterone-Enanthate is simply pure testosterone the potential side-effects will largely be of an estrogenic nature. When testosterone is present in the body it inevitably converts to estrogen via the aromatase process. Through this conversion some of the most commonly well-known anabolic steroid related side-effects can occur including Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues. While there is no way to predict if you will fall prey it is always important to remember total dosing can play a large role; after all, if there’s more testosterone to convert into estrogen the larger the potential buildup is. For those who are sensitive to such effects anti-estrogen medications can often be their saving grace and there are none better than aromatase inhibitors (AI’s) such as Arimidex and Letrozole. AI’s do exactly what their name implies, inhibit the aromatase process; that is correct, they stop the conversion process but they have also been shown to actually reduce the total amount of estrogen in the body as well. It is true, while the use of an AI will in most cases keep an individual free and clear of such effects in a small minority it will not but in most cases if you examine your diet, ensure it is rich in omega fatty acids, ensure your carbohydrate consumption isn’t above need, ensure dosing is adequate but not too high you will normally be absolutely fine. While Testosterone-Enanthate is generally well-tolerated there is one side-effect assured to occur in all men and it is that of testicular atrophy; however, as horrific as it might sound we cannot aptly label it an adverse effect. When we supplement with exogenous testosterone or any anabolic androgenic steroid our natural <strong>testosterone levels</strong> are suppressed, production is reduced and our testicles shrink. No, our testicles do not shrink into thin air, they simply lose some of their fullness but it is only temporary. Once all anabolic steroid use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks, natural production will begin again and the testicles will return to their normal size. Further, while exogenous hormones are being used and natural production is suppressed, if we are using Testosterone-Enanthate we have no chance in suffering from low level symptoms because we are providing our body and in many cases more testosterone than it already needs for proper health and function. It must be noted, for the TRT patient as he will likely remain on therapy the rest of his life there will be no breaks and testicular atrophy will remain.</p><h3>The New England Journal of Medicine:</h3><p>You’ve heard the stories; steroids will kill you, steroids will turn you into a raging lunatic, steroids will rot your brain, explode your heart and everything in-between and if you ask anyone with half a brain none of this sounds like too much fun. Even so, the question remains, is it the truth? We know from a simple look at statistics that there has never been a death directly caused by anabolic androgenic steroids and we have seen evidence that destroys many of the supposed health concerns time and time again but none is more telling than the 1996 study done by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) titled “The Effects of Supraphysiological Doses of Testosterone on Muscle Size and Strength in Normal Men.” To this day it is one of the more thorough studies regarding <strong>anabolic steroid</strong> use, one done not only in a controlled manner but without emotional bias; only the facts are present. More importantly the term “Supraphysiological” refers to doses beyond therapeutic; that’s right, in the case of the NEJM study we’re talking about performance enhancement. While you can find the full study on the NEJM website a brief overview and summary will give you a good understanding. 40 men ages 19-49 were placed in four groups of ten. None of the men had ever supplemented with anabolic androgenic steroids or used any recreational drug and each man was free from any psychiatric or behavioral disorder. All 40 men were of reasonable good health and broken down into the four following categories:</p><ul><li>Group One: Placebo with no exercise</li><li>Group Two: Testosterone with no exercise</li><li>Group Three: Placebo with exercise</li><li>Group Four: Testosterone with exercise</li></ul><p>Each man was instructed to follow a diet based on standardized RDA requirements and such diets were monitored closely for several weeks until the actual testing began. In the test the men not given testosterone is a simple result, they were given no testosterone and are of little concern here; however, you can again see the full results of the study on the NEJM website but here we are only concerned with the 20 men who actually received <strong>testosterone injections</strong>. Of the 20 men each received 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for a total of 10 weeks; keep in mind, 600mg per week is generally three times the amount of the standard highest therapeutic dose given to most patients who suffer from low testosterone; again, this is very much a performance level dosing. Of the 20 men who received the Testosterone-Enanthate the physical results of a positive nature were akin to the benefits we have explained here; increases in strength, muscle tissue, decreases in body-fat, etc. While that’s all well and fine what most people want to know about is the side-effects and this is where things get interesting; after all, it’s no secret that anabolic steroids work. In the study, of the 20 men who were given 600mg of Testosterone-Enanthate per week for 10 weeks no one died, no one had a heart attack and no one had a stroke; but what about the specific health effects?</p><ul><li>“The serum liver-enzyme concentrations, hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrits, and red-cell counts did not change in any study group”</li><li>“Plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides did not change in any study group”</li><li>“There was no change in the serum concentration of prostate-specific antigen in any group”</li><li>“No significant changes in mood or behavior were reported by the men on the Mood Inventory or by their live-in partners, spouses, or parents on the Observer Mood Inventory”</li></ul><p>The results of the test speak for themselves.</p><h3>Testosterone-Enanthate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Be it for the purpose of performance enhancing, bulking or cutting, be it for the purpose of treating low testosterone you will be hard pressed to find anything better than pure testosterone and luckily for you that’s exactly what Testosterone-Enanthate is. For the performance enhancer generally 500mg per week of <strong>Testosterone-Enanthate</strong> is a good standard dose, especially for a beginner but for many seasoned veterans as well. 500mg per week can be used very safely and with very good results and is an excellent foundation for any anabolic steroid stack; in-fact, regardless of your dose testosterone in general is always the best foundational stone. While 500mg is a quality amount that will do more for you than you could ever hope for without, many will supplement with more and doses upwards of 1,000mg per week are not uncommon among the veteran hardcore. While there is no way we can recommend such doses outright many seem to be fine with them but long-term evidence and studies are lacking in this regard to say with any assured certainty. Further, as we have explained, when doses increase so does the probability of negative effects so if you choose to supplement this high you must proceed with extra caution. For the average man even in a hardcore sense 1,000mg per week is about as high as he’ll ever go, in the elite level, especially in competitive bodybuilding doses can get much higher but some level of an adverse reaction is almost guaranteed when it does. Remember, responsible use will always be your best friend and responsible use will include periods of discontinuing use and will be accompanied by a quality <strong>Post Cycle Therapy</strong> (PCT) plan. A PCT plan is designed not only to aid in normalizing your body but further to stimulate the production of the essential testosterone hormone. While no PCT will in its own right bring production back to 100% it will send you on your way to just that much faster than without and the sooner this can be achieved the healthier you’ll be as well as more of your progress will be maintained. A quality PCT will always include a quality SERM such as Nolvadex or Clomid and often will include the greatly beneficial hCGhormone.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Testen Arenis

in-fact, all anabolic androgenicsteroids owe their allegiance to the testosterone hormone, for without it they would not exist. Of all the forms of anabolic steroids it is testosterone that was first and regarding mass productionTestosterone-Propionate was the first to hit the shelves in mass quantity ready for human use. Testosterone-Propionate is one of the longest existing <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> and since its inception and into the present day it has remained one of the most popular of all time. Its popularity stems from many points but first and foremost it remains popular because it is simply pure testosterone, a hormone of great anabolic and androgenic power. Further, as we will shortly see testosterone is one of the more versatile hormones we can ever become acquainted with and while all testosterone forms are simply that, testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate holds a special place in the hearts of many performance enhancers due to its fast acting nature. Regardless of anything else Testosterone-Propionate is the easiest testosterone form to control, it is very easy to maintain stable levels, easy to control in-terms of side-effects and generally one of the more user friendly anabolic androgenic steroids anyone could ever choose. Thankfully the supply of Testosterone-Propionate is also through the roof as every underground lab and every steroidal compounding Pharmacy manufactures this testosterone compound making it one of the more readily available and affordable anabolic steroids.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is a hormone produced by both men and women and is essential to our very functioning existence. As it is responsible for a host of functions we can see the majority of the functions when we examine low levels of the hormone and the negative effects it can cause. As for Testosterone-Propionate, what we have is identical to the testosterone hormone you naturally produced, the only difference being <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> is synthetically manufactured. How important is the testosterone hormone? Largely the examination of low levels can tell us everything we need to know and while low levels in of themselves are not life-threatening they can be beyond problematic and lead to many problems that can be life-threatening indeed; look at it like opening a door that should remained closed. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone and while more men will fall prey many women do as well, will often find symptoms such as increases in body-fat, loss of muscle tissue and strength, the inability to lose body-fat even when dieting and exercising, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction in men, a weakened immune system, lethargy, depression, a lack of mental focus, a lack of clarity of thought; the list goes on and on. Again, directly none of these conditions are life-threatening but you’d be hard pressed to make a positive argument regarding a single one. Further, it’s no secret, excess body-fat and a loss of muscle tissue is well-known to be the gateway to many serious physical problems, many of which are quite life-threatening indeed. An interesting note, in recent year’s low testosterone has also been linked to dementia, most notably regarding fatal Alzheimer’s disease. For the individual who suffers from low levels, when he supplements with testosterone and Testosterone-Propionate can be used for just that, he will in-fact see each and every area that was once found lacking improved upon and to a strong degree this is exactly how we can look at performance enhancing. For the performance enhancer the idea is simple, to take the <strong>levels of testosterone</strong> past what can be produced naturally thereby enhancing the traits and functions for what it is responsible for greatly. It really is that simple and is nowhere nearly as complicated as many like to make it out to be. So how does it all work? By its nature and direct mode of action Testosterone-Propionate as a pure testosterone form greatly increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis. Both of these traits are key factors in building lean tissue as well as preserving it and as lean tissue increases so does our overall metabolic rate. If nothing else this makes the hormone immeasurable in-terms of how truly beneficial it is but as you may have guessed its direct mode of action goes much deeper. Testosterone-Propionate will dramatically reduce and inhibit the release of glucocorticoid hormones in the body. This is important because these are the hormones that destroy muscle tissue and promote the storage of body-fat; while you may not be familiar with all glucocorticoid hormones you’ve probably heard of one, the most famous of all, cortisol. By supplementing and increasing ourtestosterone levels through the use of <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> we now have less cortisol in our body; again, promoting greater metabolic activity. Testosterone also plays a key and vital role along with IGF-1, a naturally produced peptide hormone of immense anabolic power and importance. IGF-1 effects nearly every single cell in the human body and the more testosterone in your system the greater release of this peptide hormone there will be. IGF-1 also play a direct role alongside another peptide hormone, the most famous of all, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and it is the release of IGF-1 that plays a very important role in how much HGH you produce. While this gives you a general understanding of the testosterone hormone you still need to understand the Propionate ester. Propionate is not a steroid, it is not a hormone, it is an ester that can be attached to a hormone and testosterone is not the only one. Propionate is one of the smaller esters we have available, not the smallest but pretty close; of the most common esters used the only smaller ester most will use will be Acetate. As a small ester based testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate will become active and noticeable very quickly and as to be expected will carry a very short half-life; meaning, the total duration of activity is very short lived, thereby making frequent administration necessary. Testosterone-Propionate carries a half-life of approximately 4 days and will need to be administered at least every 3 days with every other day being far more optimal. Further, as more of an interesting note, as the Propionate ester is so small it will take up very little mass in the compound; meaning a larger portion of the compound will be pure testosterone. For example, 100mg of Testosterone-Propionate will yield more usable testosterone than 100mg of a larger ester based form such as Testosterone-Cypionate. In the end, while worthy of note it is of little consequence since dosing can easily be adjusted to receive the same amount with any form.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>As Testosterone-Propionate is just that, testosterone it is for all intense purpose one of the very few perfect anabolic androgenic steroids. Individual goals can greatly vary from treating low testosterone, performance enhancement, bulking, cutting, improving athletic performance or simple vanity and<strong>Testosterone-Propionate</strong> can have a place in each and every one. As is evident from the hormones description above Testosterone-Propionate can greatly add muscle mass, increase strength, improve metabolic efficiency, improve athletic performance and grant you a greater sense of well-being; is there really much more you could want? Further, because Testosterone-Propionate is such a fast acting anabolic steroid, while most will tolerate it very well if you are one of the few who does not for whatever reason, simply discontinuing use will be very simple as the hormone will clear in just a few days. By-and-large the simplest way to look at the benefits are as we discussed above; when we understand what testosterone is responsible for we then understand why it’s important to make sure levels are adequate if they are lacking. Further, regarding performance enhancement when we understand again what the hormone is responsible for we understand very easily how increasing our levels increases its efficiency by in-which it functions, we literally enhance the performance of the testosterone hormone.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them possible side-effects and as Testosterone-Propionate is an anabolic androgenic steroid it too carries with it possible <strong>side-effects</strong>. However, it is very important to remember testosterone is not akin to taking medicine; although steroids are often labeled “Drugs” such a label is somewhat haphazard. As you recall, testosterone is a hormone you naturally produce and have so your entire life and by basic logic the presence of testosterone will generally be very well tolerated. Even so, when we present to our body anything in exogenous form there is always some level of risk; how great the risk varies from each and every item and in the world of anabolic steroids the level of risk varies with each and every one. In the case of Testosterone-Propionate, as it is very well-tolerated in most healthy adult men most will not have any problems; however, responsible use will always be the safest route to follow. Of course it must be noted, “responsible use” can mean quite a few different things to different people but nevertheless, there are facts and there are real life experiences we can pull from to gauge our choices. Of the possible side-effects you will find they most commonly include <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and issues of a cholesterol nature as well as testicular atrophy</strong>; testicular atrophy being the one guaranteed side-effect in all men. Testicular atrophy occurs for one simple reason; the presence of anabolic androgenic steroids, even testosterone suppresses natural testosterone production. As testosterone is produced in the testicles and production comes to a halt the testicles simply shrink in size; no, contrary to popular belief they do not shrink to where you can barely see them, we’re speaking of a slight decline is fullness. Once use is discontinued your testicles will return to their normal size as natural testosterone production will begin yet again. As for the other side-effects, they are by no means guaranteed but if they do occur they will do so because of the testosterone conversion process. Testosterone converts into estrogen via the aromatase process and as excess estrogen builds up such related side-effects can become problematic. Absolutely, the total dose of Testosterone-Propionate you take will play a big role; the more testosterone in your system the more testosterone there is to convert into estrogen. Individual sensitivity will also play a large role but there are things we can do if we are sensitive or as simple precautionary measures and none is better than supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor (AI.) An AI inhibits the conversion to estrogen and further reduces the amount of estrogen in the body; as the brunt of potential side-effects are brought on by estrogen you an easily see how and why this can be so beneficial.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Misconception:</h3><p>Go to any steroid related message board and you’ll find individuals who claim Testosterone-Propionate is better suited for cutting cycles and that longer ester based testosterones should be used when bulking; the point, do not listen to these people. Testosterone-Propionate can be used for any cycle, as can pretty much any testosterone form; Testosterone-Propionate is a perfect steroid because <strong>it is pure testosterone and it is not the ester that deems it better for one purpose or the othe</strong>r. It is true, some people will hold a little less water when they use this small ester version but in most cases any water problems can be controlled with diet and the use of AI’s. As for bulking, again, as this is pure testosterone and testosterone is the best agent for a bulking cycle Testosterone-Propionate can be perfect. Yes, you’ll need to inject frequently regardless of the end goal but sometimes this isn’t really a bad thing. Frequent injections of small ester based anabolics are often much easier to control in-terms of maintaining stable and peaked levels of a particular hormone. In the end, when making your choice you’ll find Testosterone-Propionate to be a fine one regardless of anything else but other forms can be just as good.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For the Testosterone Replacement Therapy candidate generally dosing will fall in the <strong>100mg-200mg per week</strong> range and rarely surpassing this amount. However, as frequent injections are necessary most physicians will generally opt for larger ester forms, most commonly Testosterone-Cypionate so the patient only has to inject once per week. For the performance enhancer the dosing will be much larger and the varying levels will be much wider too but he must necessarily inject frequently as discussed if he is going to maintain stability. Generally the minimal dose when supplementing for performance purposes will be 100mg every other day with <strong>200mg every other day</strong> being as high as most will ever go. Yes, you an absolutely take more, there is no set in stone amount but understand such high-end doses can open up the doors to side-effects that you may have wished to remain shut. In elite level competitive sports, especially in elite level bodybuilding it is not uncommon to see doses surpass a 2,000mg per week range but this can be very harsh and there is simply no way such a dosing could ever be recommended in a responsible manner. As with all cycles, as natural testosterone production will be suppressed, once use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) is a must in order to aid and speed up the recovery process. This is where Testosterone-Propionate has a bit of advantage over many other forms of testosterone; as a small ester that clears very quickly if your cycle ends with Testosterone-Propionate and there is no other long ester gear present in your system your PCT plan can start almost immediately. Remember, the sooner we start our PCT the better off we’ll be and such rapid PCT application cannot be accomplished with long ester based testosterone. If your cycle ends with Testosterone-Propionate you could reasonably wait 3 days before PCT therapy begins; if it ends with large ester gear you will need to wait approximately 2 weeks.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Testosterone Propionate 100mg Arenis Medico (testosterone propionate) 100 mg/ml (10ml vial)</pre></div></div>",publish,,0,"2021-06-02 09:16:35",1,open,372,,,no,no,,90,,,,,,,,outofstock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/testop-testosterone-propionate-100mg-arenis-medico.jpg ! alt :  ! title : testop-testosterone-propionate-100mg-arenis-medico ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/testop-testosterone-propionate-100mg-arenis-medico/,34,,,,[],,,,[],,,simple,outofstock|rated-5,"Arenis Medico|Injectable Steroids|Injectable Steroids > Testosterone Propionate","buy testosterone propionate",

not only among gym rats but professional athletes as well. The reason is simple, although not the most potent anabolic steroid available, its generally one of the best all-purpose anabolics we have. Further, Equipoise is an anabolic steroid easily tolerated well by many women which in the case of many anabolics can be a rarity; there are very few anabolic steroids available that dont produce often horrendous side-effects in women. In short, Equipoise is a steroid that can and is used in just about every group of athlete, male or female, professional or otherwise. Like many anabolic steroids Equipoise was not first developed for human use but like many steroids a use was found. Its original intent was for horses, not human beings but generally what works for one mammal will work for another; especially in the case of anabolic steroids.</p><h2>Equipoise Characteristics</h2><p>Because of the Undeclynate ester attached Equipoise is a slow acting steroid, much like the Decanoate ester; an ester commonly associated with long-slow acting anabolics. The half-life of Equipoiseis approximately fourteen (14) days making the need for frequent injections irrelevant on paper. However, many performance athletes will regularly inject the drug multiple times per week to maintain stable levels, as is common practice with many various anabolics. Common beneficial attributes of Equipoise include:</p><ul><li>Increased Protein Synthesis</li><li>Increased Nitrogen Levels</li><li>Increased Red-Blood Cell Counts</li><li>Appetite Stimulation</li></ul><p>The after-mentioned are some of the very positive effects of Equipoise however it should be noted, as a high quality anabolic, Equipoise is not a well-suited steroid for large increases in muscle mass. If we were to list its strongest attributes they would include:</p><ul><li>Increased Strength</li><li>Increased Vascularity</li><li>Muscle Tissue Preservation</li></ul><p>The increase in strength is a huge factor for many athletes who use <strong>Equipoise</strong> including ball players and some power lifters. However, in physique sports or for the everyday gym rat, many find its use to be best when dieting and leaning out. Granted, the increased appetite can be a problem for less disciplined individuals but it should be noted, this effect does not present itself in every Equipoise user.</p><h3>Boldenone- Undeclynate Equipoise vs. Nandrolone-Decanoate (Deca-Durabolin)</h3><p>Enter any steroid related message board and you will find a many misguided opinions on this topic. Lets be clear, these two anabolic steroids are not, repeat NOT interchangeable. These two anabolic steroids do not mimic each other in the slightest; in-fact they are very different. For a pure mass building effect<strong> Deca-Durabolin</strong> will always prove to be far more useful. One can gain mass from the use of Equipoise but not to the degree of Deca. The biggest reason for this misunderstanding is misguided information when Equipoise first hit the market, due largely in-part to the late Dan Duchaine who claimed the two drugs were similar; however, shortly after, Duchaine recanted but the myth never died. If we were to compare any anabolic steroid to Equipoise it would be testosterone; the two are very similar in composition, while in comparison to Deca they could not be any more different. Granted, both will shut your natural testosterone production down, as do most anabolics and both are good drugs for strength, but they also possess opposing traits, chemically and most notably the fact Equipoise does not possess the progestin qualities of Deca. In short, when you hear someone say you cant use both in the same cycle, ignore them; theres no logic behind this argument.</p><h3>Equipoise &amp; Women</h3><p>Equipoise is generally viewed as one of the few anabolic steroids easily tolerated by females. The largest concern for most female anabolic users is virilization effects and these seem to be slightly to even non-existent in most females who use the drug responsibly. Many women use this steroid with great success as part of a stack; however, expect the results to be far more potent than other common female stacks such as Anavar and Primobolan.</p><h3>Equipoise Detection &amp; Legality</h3><p>Equipoise has one of the longest detection times of any anabolic steroid; if you are a tested athlete you are urged to forgo its use. <em>Equipoise</em> can be detected in the urine for months even after use has been discontinued; some studies have claimed they can trace the drug back to as far as one year from the end of use. In most countries Equipoise is not legally obtainable; in most cases only through purchase from an underground lab can this drug be obtained. For that reason it is very important you understand the laws in the country you live.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Boldabolic - Boldenone-250 Arenis Medico

Drostanolone is a derivative of dihydrotestosterone, most specifically 2alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone. As a result, the structure of this steroid is that of a moderate anabolic/potent androgen which does not aromatize to estrogen. Water retention and gynecomastia are therefore not a concern with this compound; as of course here estrogen is usually the culprit. Masteron may in fact exhibit antiestrogenic activity in the body, competing with other substrates for binding to aromatase. This would reduce the conversion rate of other steroids, Masteron acting in the same manner as the oral steroid Proviron. Bodybuilders have a strong appreciation for non-aromatizing androgens, and find Masteron very useful as a cutting agent. It is likewise generally used a number of weeks prior to a competition, in an effort to bring out an improved look of density and hardness to the muscles. For this purpose Masteron should work exceptionally well so long as the body fat percentage is low enough. Provided everything fits as if should, the user can achieve that ""ripped"" look so popular to professional bodybuilding. The androgenic effect can also be crucial during this period, a time when caloric intake is drastically lowered. The user is provided added ""kick"" or ""drive"" to push through the grueling training sessions leading up to the show. Drostanoione was once also popular with athletes subject to drug testing, as for a period of time this compound was not screened for during competition. The urinary metabolites of drostanoione were recognized by the early 90's however, and this drug now adjoins a long list of anabolic/androgenic steroids identifiable during urinalysis testing. Although some bodybuilders claim they can safely use Masteron if discontinued three to four weeks before a test, there are always uncertainties with the use of esterified injectable steroids. This perhaps makes the oral DHT Proviron (1-ethyldihydrotestosterone) a slightly better choice, as orals offer much better control. Recreational users might also be interested in Masteron. Although dihydrotestosterone is not highly active in muscle tissue, the 2 alkylation present on drostanoione considerably intensifies its anabolic effect. It can therefore be used somewhat effectively as bulking agent, providing a consistent gain of high quality muscle mass. It can also be successfully combined with other steroids for an enhanced effect. Mixing drostanoione with an injectable anabolic such as Deca-Durabolin (nandroione decanoate) or Equipoise (boldenone undecylenate) can prove quite useful for example, the two providing notably enhanced muscle gain without excessive water retention. For greater mass gains, one can alternately addition a stronger androgen such as Dianabol or an injectable testosterone. The result here can be an extreme muscle gain, with a lower level of water retention &amp; other estrogenic side effects than if these steroids were used alone (usually in higher doses). Masteron could of course be used during cutting phases of training as well. A cycle of this drug combined with Winstrol, Primobolan or Cxandrolone should provide great muscle retention and fat loss, during a period which can be very catabolic without steroids. It is an added benefit that none of these steroids aromatize, and therefore there is no additional worry of unwanted water/fat retention. The propionate ester used with this compound will extend its activity for only a few days. With such a short duration of effect, injections need to be repeated at least every 3 or 4 days in order to maintain a consistent level of hormone in the blood. Factoring this in with its low strength (50 mg/ml), men will generally inject a full 2 ml ampule of Masteron (100 mg) every two or three days. The weekly dosage therefore lands in the range of 200-350 mg, a level more than sufficient to receive good results. We also should mention that while some women do profess to using this item before a show, it is much too androgenic in nature to recommend. Virilization symptoms can result quickly with its use, making Masteron a very risky item to experiment with. If attempted, the dosage should be limited to no more than 25 to 50 mg each week. The female athlete would be further served by increasing the number of days between injections to prevent buildup of steroid in the body. In this case, Masteron can perhaps be administered once every 7 days. Since estrogen offers us no trouble, side effects are generally mild with this steroid. As discussed earlier, gynecomastia and water retention go unseen. So are problems controlling blood pressure, again usually associated with estrogen. Masteron is also not liver toxic, so there is little concern stress will be placed on this organ, even during longer cycles. The only prominent side effects stem from the basic androgenic properties of dihydrotestosterone. This includes oily skin, acne, body/facial hair growth, aggression and accelerated hair loss. Since this compound is already a synthetic DHT, Proscar would have no impact on the level of androgenic effects. Men with a receding hairline (or those with a known familial predisposition for baldness) may therefore wish to stay away from Masteron completely, as the potent androgenic effect of this steroid can easily exacerbate such a condition.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Mastorop-100

slightly more powerful than Anavar it will prove to be milder than most all the rest. A DHT based steroid, it is very common to comparePrimobolan Depot (Methenolone Enanthate) to Masteron (Drostanolone) but this is an inaccurate assumption but if you know anything about anabolic steroids then you know assumptions run wild. Primobolan Depot does possess a higher anabolic rating than Masteron but the results tell a very different story. Generally speaking Primobolan Depot is a very weak steroid, much weaker than most other DHT based steroids. However, it is also one of the safest we can use and can be stacked with almost any other steroid imaginable. Primobolan Depot is not a steroid you will want to build your stack around but it can be a nice addition to a solid stack but when used alone, especially in males it will normally produce subpar results. While this is a very mild steroid there is an ora of greatness that surrounds it due to its rumored heavy use in the 1970’s among top bodybuilders but it’s important to understand, as great as these physiques were they were not built on Primobolan Depot alone.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Uses:</h3><p>Primobolan Depot proves to be a poor choice for most bulking cycles as it is not designed to increase size to any great degree. Yes, you can use it during your bulker safely but you would necessarily need to use a massive amounts and due to this steroid being one of the most expensive of all time this would not be an efficient choice. <strong>Primobolan Depot</strong> is so expensive you can expect to pay upwards of 3 times the amount as you would for testosterone and since massive amounts would need to be used for bulking this would destroy your wallet. For a cutting cycle things begin to change; obviously we will still be paying a fairly high amount for the steroid but we will not need to use as much to see results. Primobolan Depot does possess some decent anti-catabolic qualities as well as having the ability to increase nitrogen retention in the muscles which are both two fantastic qualities in any cutting cycle when calorie consumption is low. However, these same effects can be found in a greater degree with many other steroids; for the male steroid user who is wanting to serve this purpose, Masteron will prove to be a better choice andTrenbolone the best choice of all; however, neither of those steroids will prove to be as safe as Primobolan Depot.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Side-Effects:</h3><p>There are some general rules we can apply to anabolic steroids and <strong>side-effects</strong> that apply greatly to all steroids. The higher the dose the higher the risk of negative side-effects; further, the milder the steroid or the weaker in nature the milder its side-effects will be and Primobolan Depot makes no exception to these rules. As aromatizing is often a primary concern for many steroid users there is good news in this case; Primobolan Depot will not aromatize at all making estrogenic related side-effects no concern at all. Hair loss however is another story, this steroid can lead to it in a greater degree than many others but this will prove to be largely genetically based; meaning you were going to go bald anyway, Primobolan Depot only sped it up. Interestingly this steroid is also very <strong>side-effect</strong> friendly to female users; <strong>virilization</strong> can occur when too much is used for too long but most women who keep the dose low and short lived will be fine. Women who use Primobolan Depot and begin to see signs of virilization early on can reverse them if they discontinue use immediately but if you ignore them it becomes a different story.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Myth:</h3><p>For reasons that make zero sense a myth surrounding Primobolan Depot has existed for years, that its use will not suppress natural testosterone production. Granted, it is true, this steroid will not shut you down as harshly as many others but it will still shut you down. Countless data has shown us Primobolan Depot decreases both Luteinizing hormones, as well as Follicle-stimulating hormones, both of which are essential for testosterone production; without these two hormones there is no testosterone. Understand this simple truth, we understand your very special and “Bro Science” has told you Primobolan Depot won’t shut you down but understand the reality is far from this assumption. For the slow, yes, it will absolutely shut down your natural testosterone production.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/1ml (10ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Primoten-100

Milk thistle has been used for over 2,000 years as a natural treatment for liver disorders. The plant is known in scientific circles as the Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner (syn. Cardous marianus)<strong>, </strong>but it is more commonly known as “milk thistle,” “St. Mary Thistle,” “Holy Thistle” and “Lady’s Thistle.” It is an herbaceous annual or biennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family that can grow to be ten feet tall with flowers that are red and purple in color. Milk thistle gets its name from the milky white fluid that comes from the plant’s leaves when they are crushed. It is native to southern Europe, southern Russia, Asia Minor, and North Africa, and has also been naturalized to North and South America. Europeans were among the first to use milk thistle seeds as an herbal treatment for liver disorders. However, the plant’s remedial capabilities have been known since ancient times. Milk Thistle was mentioned by Theophrastus in the 4th century B.C. by the name of “Pternix” and it was also referred to by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century A.D. by the name of “Sillybum.” Additionally, in 1744, Von Haller documented the specific use of the plant for liver disorders in its “Medizinischen Lexicon.” In more recent years, many authors such as Johann Gottfried Rademacher, Volker Schulz, and Henry Leclerc mention the benefits of Silybum Marianum (milk thistle) when used as a treatment of liver diseases as well as in the treatment of disorders of the bile duct and spleen.</p><h3 id=""benefits"">What are the Benefits of Milk Thistle?</h3><p>Over the past forty years, intensive chemical, pharmacological and clinical research has confirmed the mechanisms of action and therapeutic value of milk thistle in a wide range of human liver-related and non-liver-related conditions. Literally hundreds of modern research studies have confirmed the remarkable ability of milk thistle to protect the liver and the body against virtually all types of damage. Additionally, the United States National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have cataloged more than 400 scientific studies of milk thistle and its active compounds in their medicine database. These studies reflect what generations past knew and depended on – that milk thistle is one of the most valuable and beneficial herbal remedies and treatments available anywhere in the world. Today, milk thistle is still one of the most commonly used medicinal plants in the world and is also the number one recommended natural herb for liver health. In fact, <strong>in Europe, milk thistle is a prescribed medication</strong>. The milk thistle extract is prescribed to treat mushroom poisoning, alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, drug and alcohol-induced liver damage and acute viral hepatitis, just to name a few. Milk thistle extract is used to maintain liver health and to protect the liver from the effects of toxins such as alcohol, a polluted environment or workplace, and a host of liver related diseases. <strong>Liver related conditions indicating the use of milk thistle</strong> are varied, including, but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Alcoholic cirrhosis</li><li>Chronic active hepatitis</li><li>Drug and alcohol induced liver damage</li><li>Acute viral hepatitis</li><li>Fatty liver, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)</li><li>Fibrosis and Cirrhosis</li><li>Hepatic toxicity caused by steroid usage</li><li>Environmental sensitivities and toxins</li><li>A medical condition that necessitates the use of hepatotoxic medications</li><li>Regular moderate-to-heavy alcohol use</li></ul><p>Additionally, experimental and clinical studies suggest that milk thistle extracts also have the following <strong>non-liver related benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li>Lowers cholesterol levels, which benefits the heart</li><li>Reduces the growth of cancer cells in breast, lung, colon, prostate, cervical and renal cancers</li><li>Functions as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease</li><li>Improves blood sugar levels</li><li>Contains numerous anti-aging properties</li><li>Reduces cell damage caused by radiation and chemotherapy treatments</li><li>Supplements sunscreen protection and may be useful against multiple types of skin disease</li><li>Works as a free radical scavenger and powerful antioxidant</li><li>Reduces hot flashes and other related menopausal symptoms</li><li>Helps with intestinal / indigestion issues</li><li>Reduces the effects of deathcap mushroom (Amanita phalloides) poisoning</li></ul><h3 id=""work"">How Does Milk Thistle Work?</h3><p>Milk thistle seeds contain a bioflavonoid complex known as silymarin. Silymarin, which is the active ingredient in milk thistle, is simply the purified extract of the fruits (seeds) of the milk thistle plant. It is responsible for the main medical benefits of the milk thistle plant, and it is made up of three main flavonoids:</p><ul><li>silybin – also know as silibinin</li><li>silydianin – also known as silidianin</li><li>silychristin – also know as silicristin</li></ul><p>Silybin makes up 50% – 70% of silymarin and has been shown in clinical studies to be the <strong>most biologically active and beneficial constituent</strong> of the milk thistle extract, silymarin. Double blind studies on the effect of milk thistle on toxic liver damage (mostly alcohol-related), chronic liver disease and disease caused by certain drugs have been reviewed by medical experts. The experts all concluded that milk thistle is an extremely therapeutically useful medicinal plant product that stabilizes the cell membrane and stimulates protein synthesis while accelerating the process of regeneration in damaged liver tissue. These effects are important in the therapeutic efficacy of milk thistle. According to other studies, milk thistle may protect the cells of the liver by blocking the entrance of harmful toxins and helping remove these toxins from liver cells. As with other flavonoids, milk thistle is a powerful antioxidant which works to maintain health and energy by protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals and lipid peroxidation, which can injure healthy cells and tissues. Just as grapes and red wine, for example, are touted as excellent sources of antioxidants, milk thistle also contains the properties needed to offer the body the same antioxidant benefits.</p><h3 id=""sideeffects"">What are the Side Effects of Milk Thistle?</h3><p>One of the best things about milk thistle is its gentle nature. Compared to many other supplements and herbal remedies that bring with them side effects such as headaches, virtually all parts of the milk thistle plant have been used with no reports of toxicity. Adverse effects in clinical and lab studies related specifically to the seed extract (silymarin) are also virtually nonexistent, although it may have a mild and short-lived laxative effect for some people. Milk thistle can be used safely and effectively by a wide range of people, including pregnant and nursing women.</p><h3 id=""standardized"">What is Standardized Milk Thistle?</h3><p>Milk thistle as an herb is made up of both active and inactive ingredients in varying amounts, with the active ingredients providing all of the supplement’s benefits and therapeutic value. When purchasing a non-standardized milk thistle product, you have no way of knowing what proportion of active to inactive ingredients will be present in the final product. Thus, to ensure consistency throughout the herbal supplement market, milk thistle is available in a standardized form. When purchasing a standardized milk thistle product, you are supposed to receive the same proportion of the active and beneficial ingredients to inactive ingredients each and every time. Today, most standardized milk thistle products sold in the United States are standardized to reflect 80% silymarin. This means that silymarin, the active ingredient, makes up 80% of the total weight of the product, and the inactive ingredients make up the remaining 20%. So if you purchase a standardized milk thistle product that is 250 milligrams of 80% standardized silymarin, you would actually have only 200 milligrams of the active, beneficial ingredient. It is important to understand this so that you know what you are comparing when you are looking at different milk thistle products to determine those that offer the best value and those that offer the best concentration of the active ingredient.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">150mg/1 tab.

Largely thanks to the massive media attention the drug has received over the years but more so due to the idea surrounding Winstrol as a Cutting steroid. Lets be clear, almost any anabolic steroid can be used to Cut or drop body-fat; the use of the words <strong>Cutting Steroids</strong> should only be taken with a grain of salt and that includes when talking about Winstrols.</p><h2>Overview of Effects</h2><p>Winstrol is an anabolic steroid with very low androgenic qualities yet highly anabolic. Its strengths lie within its ability to promote increases in strength, as well as harden an already lean physique. This hardening effect is what has led Winstrol to be known as a Cutting Steroid in many circles but make no mistake, Winstrol will not magically rip you to shreds; you must possess already low levels of body fat for it to give your body a harder more defined appearance. Yes, absolutely, Winstrol can help you achieve a lower body fat but all anabolic steroids can do this with just as much success. Winstrol is a long standing favorite of the bodybuilding world due to its hardening effects but somebodybuilders swear by it even in their off-season as a means to solidify gains or to increase strength during a cycle, thereby enabling them to push more weight and grow. However, although this is not the most common use of the drug it is also not recommended. Winstrol is one of the most toxic anabolic steroids to the liver and<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#91811432""> cycles<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> of Winstrol are best run for short durations of six to eight weeks and not during Bulking cycles; save Winstrol for other purposes. Beyond the bodybuilding world <strong>Winstrol</strong> has firmly placed itself on the pedestal of most well-knownanabolics on the planet thanks to its use in professional sports by individuals in just about every professional sport imaginable. Winstrol as we discussed can greatly increase strength and this includes an increase in ones strength of speed. Further, due to its inability to promote massive gains in muscle tissue, it is a drug that can be used in low doses without generating a lot of suspicion. More importantly, Winstrol is only detectable for a very short period of time and is very, very easy to cover up if a drug test is made known to the athlete; these things make Winstrol a top choice for many professional athletes and for obvious reasons. It should be noted, the <strong>drug Winstrol</strong> and the <strong>drug Stanozolol</strong> are one in the same. <strong>Stanozolol is the official drug name</strong>. Many anabolic steroids carry a name based on the name of their original producer, for example the drug commonly known as Dianabol is specifically and more correctly known as Methandrostenolone; the same concepts applies here with Stanozolol or as you know it, Winstrol or Winstrol Depot.</p><h2>Effects of Winstrol</h2><p>Like all anabolic steroidal hormones the effects of Winstrol can be broken down into two distinct categories; the positive effects and adverse effects. By its nature, as we will see the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a stronger physique; such a trait can be perfect for an athlete looking for more strength and speed. Further, the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a better looking physique making it an excellent contest prep bodybuilding steroid and one for gym rats desiring a similar looking physique. Of course this steroid is not without fault as the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Such effects can range from common DHT related, to liver toxicity and of course<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#89096193""> natural<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> testosterone suppression. Of course the hormone can be used safely and while some side-effects are indeed very genetically based revolving around individual response, most who supplement responsibly will have very few if any serious problems. Let’s take a look at the effects of Winstrol and discover how we can best maximize the effects within this DHT based steroid.</p><h3>The Positive Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Without question the primary positive effects of Winstrol revolve around strength and overall athletic performance; in-fact, it is athletic performance that has made this steroid so popular. This increase in strength can be translated into direct physical power, speed and simply a better performing athlete. No, the hormone will not create non-existing talent; it will simply enhance the talents already in place. Like all anabolic steroids the effects of Winstrol do not create an athlete, they simply enhance already existing athletic talent. Beyond performance athletics this steroid has a welcomed home in the physique inspired world as the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote this end. While a very poor mass building steroid the effects of Winstrol in this regard largely surround dieting phases. Winstrol is very apt for preserving lean tissue and strength when calories are restricted; ask any bodybuilder and he’ll assure you this is a more than welcomed trait. Further, by its nature the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a harder and more vascular look; key components to the physique game. Of course it must be noted this hormone will not make a fat physique ripped. To enjoy these physique enhancing qualities the athlete will need to be fairly lean to begin with if they are going to show; contrary to popular culture belief anabolic steroids are not magical.</p><h3>The Adverse Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Like all anabolic steroids the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Of course simply stating adverse reactions may occur is not enough, factors such as individual response, total dosing and time of use must be taken into consideration. For example, the higher the dose and the longer we supplement the greater potential there is for negative effects; this may sound obvious and perhaps over simplistic but these are factors many choose to ignore. What are the possible adverse effects of Winstrol use? A few of these are guaranteed, some are genetically dependent and one is very individual based on behavior. The effects of Winstrol in this category include:</p><ul><li>Cholesterol Issues: Winstrol can lower your HDL and increase your LDL. Those who already have cholesterol issues should avoid this steroid. Those who do not, who supplement responsibly and live a lifestyle that promotes healthy cholesterol levels will not have any problems.</li><li>Liver Toxicity: As a C17-aa anabolic steroid the effects of Winstrol include liver toxicity. This occurs due to the structural change associated with all C17-aa steroids. While unfortunate this structural change is necessary for the hormone to survive ingestion and administration. By this nature liver enzyme levels will increase when the hormone is used. However, if we are responsible in our supplementation, as the liver rejuvenates quickly enzyme levels will return to normal<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#5419076""> shortly<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> after use is discontinued leaving no permanent damage. It is however highly advised you avoid heavy alcohol consumption when this hormone is in play.</li><li>Hair-Loss: As a DHT based anabolic steroid those predisposed to hair-loss may find they lose some hair with Winstrol supplementation. Those who are not predisposed will not lose the first hair on their head. Put simply, if you lose any hair you were going to lose it anyway; the Winstrol simply sped it up.</li><li>Acne: Another DHT based effect and again it will be of concern to those genetically predisposed. The majority of people will have no problem but if you are acne sensitive this steroid may cause breakouts. For this reason it is important you keep your skin very clean and always ensure your product is of a clean and pure nature.</li><li>Testosterone Suppression: For some reason many performance enhancers believe the effects of Winstrol do not include testosterone suppression; we assure you it does. For this reason you are highly encouraged to seek out remedy with exogenous testosterone use being your best bet.</li></ul><h2>Winstrol Cycle</h2><p>A Winstrol cycle is one of the most common anabolic steroid cycles of all. Somewhat mild in nature when compared to many other anabolic steroids this is a steroid well-suited for strengthening athletes in all sports and a very good bodybuilding contest prep hormone. While the basic Winstrol cycle has been part of sports for a very long time it reached new levels of popularity during the 1988 Summer Olympics when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, the hormone that makes Winstrol. While not the best bulking steroid for men a Winstrol cycle can be successfully run by female athletes in both bulking and dieting phases and as such is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be used safely by women. Regardless of sex or specific purpose of use a Winstrol cycle can provide fantastic gains to help you achieve your desired end. Let’s delve in and see what we can find.</p><h3>Injectable &amp; Tablet Forms:</h3><p>A solid Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) based anabolic hormone, Stanozolol can be commonly found in both injectable and tablet form. Regardless of the form you have the same Stanozolol hormone and your Winstrol cycle will be just as effective with either form. It is true that the injectable form is slightly more potent and on this basis some will always choose this form for their Winstrol cycle. Further, as a very liver toxic steroid due to its C17-aa nature many assume the injectable is a safer option. Let’s be clear, while slightly more potent in its injectable form the difference is negligible at best. As for liver toxicity, the injectable form of Stanozolol is also of a C17-aa nature just like the tablet; both forms are highly liver toxic. When you’re planning your Winstrol cycle the only thing that really matters is ensuring your product is of a high quality nature; beyond this the form does not matter.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Women:</h3><p>While anabolic steroid use can be very dangerous for women due to virilization effects, Winstrol remains one of the few choices females have at their disposal. Virilization symptoms appear to be much lower when supplementation is of a responsible nature but we must stress while the odds are in your favor virilization may still occur. If such symptoms begin to show the athlete should discontinue use immediately before they set in permanently. Most women will find a Winstrol cycle of 6 weeks in length to be sufficient at a dosing of 10mg every other day to every day depending on the athlete, desired end and response to the hormone. Some women may be able to tolerate as much as a 20mg dose but they should be forewarned that virilization will become a stronger reality. While a Winstrol cycle can be a solid option for the female athlete Anavar still remains our primary choice for female athletes.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Men:</h3><p>For the male Winstrol cycle, regardless of purpose of use 6-8 weeks of total use will normally suffice. For athletes looking for a boost in performance a dosing of 50mg every other day will in most all cases provide what they are looking for. Of course some will want more and if more is needed and this will be common in competitive bodybuilding circles or simply those looking for a similar physique a dose of 50mg every day can provide this end. As for doses of a higher nature, 100mg per day is the most Stanozolol any man will ever want to take and such a dose can only be recommended for very short periods of time. Such a case might be for a competitive bodybuilder right before his competition, say the last 10-14 days leading up to the show. In all cases most men will find this to be a poor mass building steroid as the very nature of Stanozolol will not readily promote this end. It can have bulking benefits due to its ability to increase synergy between other anabolic steroids but due to it being so toxic to the liver use should be limited to specific and most beneficial times. If one will save his Winstrol cycle for such phases of use he will most certainly find the hormone to be highly beneficial.</p><h2>Winstrol Pills</h2><p>Winstrol pills are one of the most common forms of the anabolic steroid hormone Stanozolol if for no other reason than their ease of use. While available in an injectable solution as well, in either case pill or injectable you have the same Stanozolol hormone at hand. While ease of use may make Winstrol pills more popular than the injectable form in many circles what truly makes this one of the most popular steroids of all time is simply by the way it functions. The Stanozolol hormone is not well-suited for building mass, in-fact, it won’t do much at all in this regard but the traits and benefits it will bring to the table are worth their weight in gold to most any performance enhancer.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills &amp; the Injectable Myth:</h3><p>It’s commonly understood that as a C17-aa anabolic steroid Winstrol pills are very toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is the truth. However, it is commonly believed that the injectable form commonly known as Winstrol Depot is not toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is a myth. The injectable form is also of a C17-aa nature, in-fact, you can actually administer the injectable form orally simply by drinking it. In both cases, Winstrol pills or Winstrol Depot you have the same Stanozolol hormone in a C17-aa form by-which is necessary for the hormones survival in the body. As such the total time of use should be limited and dosing should always be of a responsible level. If you can hold to this practice any effect the hormone has on your liver enzymes will not be of a permanent nature as the liver has amazing rejuvenating qualities.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills Dosing:</h3><p>Winstrol pills are most commonly found in 50mg and 10mg tablets. Regardless of the pills potency the same Stanozolol hormone is in each pill. Generally 10mg tablets will be perfect for female users as the average female dosing is 10mg per day. Some females may be able to tolerate 20mg per day for short periods of time but such a dosing can greatly increase the probability of virilization symptoms. Conversely most men will find 50mg Winstrol pills to be perfect for their needs as the average male Stanozolol dose is 50mg per day. If 50mg Winstrol pills are not available simply take the number of 10mg pills needed to meet your desired dose.</p><h3>Optimal Use:</h3><p>As a very poor bulking agent Winstrol pills will be best served when used in cutting cycles. During cutting cycles where calories are restricted the Stanozolol hormone will greatly promote tissue preservation and rejuvenation. Further, as a steroid apt towards strength, during a diet strength will be greatly preserved. Moreover, in the name of conditioning Winstrol pills will greatly promote a leaner and harder physique making this one of the more popular bodybuilding contest prep steroids. While cutting cycles are a fantastic use, Winstrol pills remain very popular in athletic circles for the purpose of simply enhancing overall athletic performance. Again, as increasing strength is this steroids greatest attribute and since strength is the end all be all for athletes this can be a fine choice. Further, as mass will not be built to a large degree and many athletes see mass as a hindrance in-terms of its effects on performance as well as the prying eyes it can invite this again makes Winstrol pills a fine choice.</p><h2>Winstrol Results</h2><p>You hear talk regarding anabolic steroids all the time but often it is in a very general sense. When most people talk about anabolic steroids visions of monstrous behemoths come to mind but what many fail to realize is that not all steroids meet this end. There are steroids that are far more suited towards building lean mass than others, there are steroids that will do more for strength and very little for mass; in the end, how big you get really boils down to how big you eat. For example, let’s examine the anabolic steroid Stanozolol commonly referred to by its most popular trade nameWinstrol. For those who supplement with this powerful DHT derived steroid Winstrol results while powerful will not translate into massive gains in size. Even in massive doses, which no one would recommend as such would be dangerous and pretty much a waste, Winstrol results will still not lead to the behemoth mentioned a few moments ago. For many this may be surprising; after all, most do not understand anabolic steroids but the truth is simple, each anabolic steroid is a little unique.</p><h3>Athletic Winstrol Results:</h3><p>The Stanozolol hormone has been very popular in the world of competitive sports for decades; we’re talking about everything from football to baseball and even track and field; in-fact, it is track and field that gave this steroid world renowned popularity. The reason is simple; Winstrol results in increased strength and increased speed in the athlete. This not only enables the athlete to train harder but garners him the ability to perform his desired sport at the highest level. To put it simply, while it may sound very simplistic it’s the easiest way to look at it; Winstrol results in a more effective and efficient athlete. No, it will not make a terrible athlete a great one; this is something many fail to understand about anabolic androgenic steroids in general; it will however allow and enable the athlete to perform at his or her peak potential of which cannot be obtained without.</p><h3>Primary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>When supplementing with this steroid the primary Winstrol results will be that of an increase in strength. Such an increase can be translated into direct physical power, the ability to move more weight and it can also be translated into more speed producing a faster athlete. As this is the primary trait it remains Stanozolol is one of the most popular anabolic steroids among performance athletes; so much so it finds its way into most any sport and in amounts that would probably blow your mind. It is true, while supplemental use of Winstrol results in very little mass increase some lean tissue may be gained but as this steroid does not aromatize each and every ounce gained will be that of pure lean muscle mass. With strength still being the primary trait dieting athletes, especially those of a physique nature may find this trait to be very beneficial. When we diet our strength generally declines as calories are restricted. When you diet you’re taking in fewer calories than you need to maintain your weight and often strength pays the price. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in such strength being greatly preserved as the hormone will aid in preserving lean muscle tissue. Of course the leaner we get the harder this will become but you can guarantee you’ll hold onto a lot more strength with this hormone in play than if not.</p><h3>Secondary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>In some ways lean tissue preservation could be placed in this category as strength is the primary trait but it also fits here. As we hold onto more lean tissue when dieting our metabolism is enhanced and as Winstrol results in a faster metabolism by the manner in-which the hormone performs in the body our metabolism is enhanced all the more. You may be thinking we’re putting too much emphasis on metabolism but for those who understand how difficult burning body-fat can be while trying to maintain lean tissue these people understand how invaluable metabolic related traits can be. Other secondary Winstrol results also fall into the dieting field. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in a harder and more defined physique and one that is more vascular to boot. This makes the Stanozolol hormone very popular in competitive bodybuilding circles as a lean, hard and vascular physique is the name of the game. We must stress and would be remised to leave this out; Winstrol will not magically turn a fat physique into a granite statue, you must already be somewhat lean to display these physique related traits. However, while that is true, if you are lean you will find Winstrol results in a much more impressive physique than a physique that is absent the hormone.</p><h2>Winstrol Side-Effects</h2><p>Moderately mild in nature, the hormone Stanozolol is one of the more popular anabolic steroidsamong avid performance enhancers; you know it best as Winstrol. Generally best served used in cutting cycles or as a direct athletic performance enhancer due to its ability to increases strength, while moderately mild Winstrol side-effects are very real indeed. While adverse Winstrol side-effects may occur they are by no means guaranteed. There are many factors that must be considered and if responsible use is implored you will find this is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be safely used by most any athlete. An anabolic steroid of the DHT class Stanozolol will not aromatize at all making common steroidal problems such as Gynecomastia and water retention of no concern; with that in mind, let’s take a look at the possible Winstrol side-effects and discover what we need to know.</p><h3>Severe Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Of all the possible adverse Winstrol side-effects issues surrounding cholesterol will prove to be the most serious of all. As you understand cholesterol is generally broken down into two categories, LDL, the bad cholesterol and HDL, the good cholesterol your body needs. The Stanozolol hormone can have a negative effect on both cholesterol readings and those who are predisposed to cholesterol issues or who already suffer from a poor condition should avoid this steroid like the plague. To combat these possible cholesterol issues we must keep our total dosing at a responsible level and limit the time of use to a responsible time frame. Further, following a diet that is cholesterol friendly will do more for you than anything else; those who fail to do so even when their Stanozolol use is of a responsible nature may find they fall prey to problems.</p><h3>Liver Related Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>It is generally commonly understood that the Stanozolol hormone is of a strong hepatic nature; simply put, of all the adverse Winstrol side-effects it remains liver toxicity is one of the most common. By its very existence the Stanozolol hormone belongs to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroidal hormones. This is classification is defined by a structural alteration to the hormone that allows it to survive ingestion; without such a structural change the hormone would be destroyed before any benefit could take place. While this structural change allows the hormone to survive its first pass through the liver it also makes it very toxic; it is a tradeoff and one that is unavoidable. It is a common misconception held by many performance enhancers that only the oral form of this hormone is hepatic in nature; this is an outright lie. Just as the oral form is C17-aa so is the injectable; in that there is no difference. When we supplement with this steroid our liver enzyme readings will go up; how much will be determined by total dosing and total time of use but they will go up none the less. For this reason, again, we must maintain a level of responsible use. For those who supplement in a responsible fashion there is some very good news. The liver has amazing rejuvenating capabilities and once use is discontinued, assuming the individual has been responsible liver enzyme levels will normalize and no permanent damage will be done. It should also be noted, during the course of use heavy alcohol consumption should be avoided; in-fact, laying off alcohol completely is probably not a bad idea.</p><h3>The Myth &amp; the Truth:</h3><p>One of the reasons Stanozolol remains so popular is because many believe Winstrol side-effects do not include testosterone suppression; how this myth started is unclear but it is a myth just the same. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production will be suppressed. Certain steroids will have a stronger effect in this regard but suppression will occur just the same. If you supplement with Winstrol your levels will fall and this is not only unhealthy but can be detrimental to your cause. For this reason some form of precaution is advised with exogenous testosterone use being your absolute best bet.</p><h3>DHT Based Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>As a DHT based anabolic hormone both hair-loss and acne can be a very real possibility; in-fact, these may be the most common Winstrol side-effects of all in-terms of visual effects. Assuring your product is clean and of a pure nature will greatly protect you from acne, as will keeping your skin extra clean; however, those who are genetically sensitive to acne may still have a problem. Those who are not genetically sensitive and who supplement with a pure product will in most all cases be fine. As for hair-loss, it is true, this is one of the primary Winstrol side-effects but it is not as cut and dry as you might think. Like acne, hair-loss is very genetically dependent. Those who are predisposed to male-pattern baldness run the greatest risk; men who are not should not lose the first hair on their head. If you are genetically predisposed to hair-loss, simply put you were going to lose some of your hair to begin with; the Stanozolol hormone simply caused this to occur sooner than it would have otherwise.</p><h2>Winstrol Stacking</h2><p>Winstrol stacking is very popular among many performance athletes as the Stanozolol hormone by-which it is comprised, is highly beneficial. In most cases Winstrol stacking will be reserved for cuttingcycles as this compound has very little use when it comes to trying to pack on size. Of course beyond cutting cycles many athletes simply use the hormone to enhance overall athletic performance; in-fact, this is one of its most common uses. However, it remains cutting cycles will be the most common point of use for Winstrol stacking as the majority of performance enhancers are physique based inspired; we’re not simply talking about bodybuilders but gym rats as well and they are the majority. We have broken down some Winstrol stacking examples for your benefit. We have provided you examples for both beginner and advanced use as well as male and female use. That is correct, Stanozolol is one of the very few anabolic steroids that can be used by women and as such Winstrol stacking is very popular among female athletes in a host of arenas. While all of this remains true our examples will be somewhat of a general nature as we cannot give you an example for each and every individual to meet their specific needs; however, for the brunt of you these Winstrol stacking plans will meet your needs to a tee.</p><h3>Female Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>While females can absolutely supplement with the Stanozolol hormone safely precaution must be applied. The general concern regarding anabolic steroids and females is virilization and fortunately Winstrol, while carrying a possibility will generally do so mildly. If a female supplements responsibly in most cases she will be fine but as we are all unique individuals, individual response will play a role. There will be some women who cannot touch this steroid even at a low dose and if problems begin to occur, you are urged to discontinue use. If you discontinue the moment problems arise they will dissipate and you will be fine. It is when these problems are ignored that they set in permanently. For most women 10mg every other day to even every day in some cases will be all the Stanozolol they need. However, some women will be able to tolerate as much as 20mg per day but this should only be tried by very experienced, very advanced and only in athletes who are in desperate need. Most women will never have a need to go above 10mg per day. We have provided two Winstrol stacking examples; a beginner to Stanozolol use and one who is more advanced with anabolic steroid cycling:</p><ol><li>Female Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/eod WK 7-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li><li>Female Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/ed WK 3-8 Primobolan Depot 100mg/wk WK 5-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li></ol><h3>Male Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>For the male athlete his Stanozolol use will fall in a bit of a different form; generally we will see use of this hormone at the back half of a cycle rather than early on in female use. Further, as it is a poor bulking choice for men, although it can benefit a woman during this time, for a man it will always be cutting cycle related. In many cases it is a bit inaccurate to label a particular steroid a bulker or a cutter but when it comes to male Stanozolol use we can make an exception; for male Stanozolol use this is a cutting steroid. The majority of men will find 50mg every day to be the perfect dosing for all their Winstrol stacking needs. Regardless of experience this will be our standard dose. Of course those who are looking for a slight anabolic bump to aid in athletic performance may only need this dose every other day and some may only need 25mg every other day; even so it remains 50mg every day will be our gold standard. Again, we have provided you two examples of Winstrol stacking, one for a beginner and one for an advanced anabolic steroid user:</p><ol><li>Male Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 400mg/wk WK 7-12 Winstrol 50mg/ed WK 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 400mg-500mg/wk</li><li>Male Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 200mg/eod WK 1-8 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 200mg-250mg/eod WK 9-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg/eod WK 9-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 100mg/eod</li></ol><p>*Note: Physique competitors may find bumping the Winstrol up to 100mg/ed the last 10-14 days to be beneficial but this would be the longest period and only reason for such use. Competitors may also find increasing the Trenbolone use to every day the last 10-14 days to be highly beneficial as well. **Note: Male Winstrol stacking examples have not included possible SERM’s, AI’s, Growth Hormone, or fat-burning agents such as Clenbuterol and Cytomel (T3) that may be highly beneficial as well; we have only focused on the steroidal part of the plan.</p><h4>***Abbreviations:</h4><p>- WK: Week - MG: Milligram - eod: Every other day - ed: Every day</p><h2>Winstrol Tablets</h2><p>Winstrol tablets are a popular form of the anabolic steroid known as Stanozolol; a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived steroid of immense popularity.

To give you some understanding as to why so many supplement let’s take a look at Winstrol tablets and see what we can unveil.</p><h3>Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>A DHT based anabolic steroid, Winstrol tablets belong to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroids as well. The C17-aa classification refers to a structural change of the hormone at the 17th carbon position that is necessary to allow the hormones survival; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver. While necessary this structural change makes C17-aa steroids rather liver toxic; in the case of Winstrol tablets we have one of the most toxic of all. However do not let your heart be troubled yet; remember,<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#43638446""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> Tylenol is toxic to the liver and we must think in relative, realistic and responsible terms. The truth is simple; the liver possess amazing rejuvenation abilities and with responsible use, although liver enzyme levels will increase during use they will return to normal very quickly once use is discontinued; again, assuming use is of a responsible nature. If that’s not enough to ease your mind regular alcohol consumption of a heavy nature is far more toxic to the liver than Winstrol tablets and it’s safe to say a lot of you don’t think twice about it. Beyond its DHT and C17-aa nature Winstrol tablets carry an active half-life of approximately 9 hours making daily administration necessary if we are to maintain stable levels of the Stanozolol hormone. When we do the hormone will perform in a highly anabolic manner with very low androgenic activity. By its function Winstrol tablets greatly increase nitrogen retention in the muscles, increase protein synthesis and dramatically lower SHBG allowing more free-testosterone to be used by the body.</p><h3>When to Supplement with Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>By its nature Winstrol tablets are not powerful mass builders; in-fact, they will do very little to promote significant growth. However, some growth can be obtained, largely due to the lower SHBG factor and by the manner in-which Stanozolol creates synergy with other anabolic steroids being used. Further, as this steroid does not aromatize at all any weight gained due to use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue; it simply won’t be much and as it is so toxic to the liver use is best served for other purposes as other options are more efficient for bulking. Without question the two best times to supplement with Winstrol tablets is during a cutting<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#45677427""> cycle<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> or a cycle designed to enhance overall athletic performance. To begin, Winstrol tablets will promote an increase in strength, as an athlete that is the name of the game; stronger and faster. It will not take a lot of this hormone to achieve this; most men will find doses of 25mg-50mg every other day to be all they need with most women only needing 10mg every other day. While enhancing athletic performance is a good use for this steroid it remains cutting cycles are the most common point of use as the majority of performance enhancers are enhancing simply to build a better physique. During a cutting cycle one will necessarily be consuming a restricted amount of calories in-order to burn fat. As calories are restricted losses of lean tissue and strength are sure to occur. Through supplemental use of the Stanozolol hormone we are able to preserve a great deal of our lean tissue and strength, thereby further enhancing our overall metabolic rate and burning even more fat. Moreover, by the manner in-which the hormone exist, when lean enough we will display a much harder and well-defined physique and for a physique minded individual there is not much more you can ask for. For this purpose most men will find a dose of 50mg every day to be more than sufficient with most women again only needing 10mg every other day, with daily doses being tolerated well in some specific cases.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>Whatever your purpose of use may be you’ll find Winstrol tablets to meet your needs and effectively so. Generally you’ll find the steroid to come in both 10mg and 50mg forms but you’ll also commonly find it available in a water base injectable solution known as Winstrol Depot. If you find the Deport version available to you nothing changes regarding what we have discussed here; it is the same DHT based Stanozolol hormone, it performs identically to Winstrol tablets and like the tablets is also a C17-aa anabolic steroid. In either case and for any purpose it is<a class=""U358416KPLPK0 C2Ck0UAiIz66"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/winstrol-stanozolol-tablets/stanozolol-tablets-our-product.html#20376147""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> to remember responsible use will always be your best friend.</p>","<p><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

The most common practice is a 4-6 week run of <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> at a dosing of 50mg per day and for many this will be all the<strong>Oxymetholone</strong> they will ever need. However, for those who want a little more and these individuals always exist, 100g per day for the same time frame can be successfully administered but there are some important notes. It is important to understand how your body reacts to this steroid before you ever begin a 100mg dose; further, understand the possibility of negative side-effects increase dramatically when the dosing is increased. While 100mg a day will prove to be the maximum dosage that can be safely used, assuming the individual knows what they’re doing, beyond 100mg will often prove to be a waste as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong>has been shown to possess a fast diminishing rate when you go past the 100g mark. This simply means doses of 150mg or 200mg and beyond will not produce results greater than 100mg or at least at any noteworthy affect. The same can also be said of total duration; past the 6 week mark the benefits of <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>supplementation will begin to largely fade. While an individual may indeed pack on as much as 20-30lbs with the steroid the first 4-6 weeks such massive increases will not occur past the 6 week mark. As is with all anabolic steroids <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> does carry with it the possibility of negative adverse side-effects and with this steroid they can be very severe; especially when responsible use is thrown to the wind. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is one of the most hepatic oral steroids on the market; as a 17-aa steroid it is very toxic to the liver but while this is the case with all 17-aa steroids it is more so here. Granted, with responsible use liver damage will often be reversed when use is discontinued but this is assuming responsible sue was implored. Further, as it is well-known for, <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can greatly cause a massive buildup in water retention, so much so that for many the effect can be unbearable. For this reason the use of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is highly advised. Further, the use of an AI will aid in the prevention of Gynecomastia as well, another possible side-effect due to use.

One must have a full understanding of the steroid to pull off such use without excess water retention being a problem but as the steroids effect on carbohydrate consumption is so pronounced it can have a positive effect when used properly for this purpose. Regardless of your purpose for use it is very important you ensure you are healthy enough for use to begin with. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can severely increase blood pressure and if your blood pressure is already high you cannot use this steroid and if you are predisposed to such a condition you are highly advised to stay away. As with most anabolic steroids supplemental testosterone is very important for the male users as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> will suppress natural testosterone production. For the female this is a steroid we cannot recommend as virilization can be very problematic when supplemental <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> is part of the female athlete’s plans.</p><h1>Anadrol</h1><h2>(Oxymetholone)</h2><p>We have so many anabolic steroids to choose from; some strong, some a little weaker and anabolicsteroids that serve every purpose imaginable but there is none more potent than that of <strong><a class=""Q54lQ7diDu3Zu Ey6Oal4I2vU"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by clnjnk"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/oxymetholone/oxymetholone-tablets-our-product.html#12707709""> Anadrol<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a></strong>, was first developed in the 1960s by Syntex Pharmaceuticals as <strong>oxymetholone</strong> with means to treat muscle wasting diseases, osteoporosis and anemia. As should come as no surprise, being as this drug was developed to treat muscle wasting diseases it would soon find its way into the performance enhancing world, as is common. Anadrol is one of the most powerful anabolic steroids on the planet; as an <strong>oral steroid</strong> there is no stronger. As powerful as Anadrol is it is also one of the most problematic in terms of unwanted side-effects. As with all anabolic steroids there is always a risk to reward ratio and makes no exception.</p><h2>Why Anadrol?</h2><p>Anadrol greatly increases protein synthesis, a key element in gaining muscle mass; further attributes include its ability to dramatically increase red-blood cell counts in the individual; this is the reason it was developed in the fight against anemia. Anadrol also belongs to a class of steroids that can greatly increase water retention; please make a note of the word Can this is not the same as Will. Although <strong>Anadrol</strong> can greatly increase the amount of water youre holding in your body what many athletes fail to understand is that ones diet greatly affects the amount of water that is held. Many competitive bodybuilders use Anadrol as part of their contest preparations in order to give them a fuller look at the end and if you know anything about bodybuilding it is that water is the enemy when youre on stage. Some individuals will be more sensitive to water retention while using Anadrol some not but either way the punch this anabolic steroid packs is unlike any other. Most Anadrol users will use the drug as part of a stack in conjunction with other anabolic <strong>steroids</strong>. The most common administration of Anadrol is at the beginning of an anabolic steroid cycle the first four to six weeks. <em>Anadrol</em> is one of the more toxic oral <strong>steroids</strong> on the market and use much longer than six weeks is not recommended. However, most Anadrol users will only see substantial gains from the drug the first four to six weeks, so any longer is usually a waste. It is not uncommon for Anadrol users to gain as much as seven to ten pounds per week the first two weeks of use; generally the gains will slow down as the weeks continue. It cannot be stressed enough; a dramatic increase in weight such as this will not occur if one is not eating to fuel such a gain. Yes, weight will still be gained but it is largely dependent on the number of calories coming in.</p><h2>Side Effects of Anadrol</h2><p>Other common side-effects of Anadrol use include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Gynecomastia</li><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>Acne</li><li>Bloating</li></ul><p>Although these side-effects can be very nasty, they can also be avoidable. When using <strong>Anadrol</strong> it is highly recommended you use a good aromatase inhibitor such as Anastrozole (Arimidex) to ward of Gynecomastia. Issues such as bloating can usually be eliminated with careful diet planning, however, Anadrol is such a powerful drug sometimes water retention can settle in the lower back region and cause a very uncomfortable feeling. As for Acne, as it is with all anabolic <strong>steroids</strong> and is with Anadrol buy human grade and normally youll be fine; however, if you are more sensitive than average some acne may occur. The next question and perhaps the most common, who is Anadrol for in-terms of the performance enhancing world and the answer is simple; anyone looking for dramatic increases in strength and size will find this anabolic steroid to be for them. Granted, the side-effects are strong, the Back Pumps many attribute to Anadrol use can at times be unbearable but if you can handle it there isnt another anabolic steroid quite like it. Oxymetholone is one of the strongest androgenic steroid available.[citation needed] Similarly, it also poses the greatest risk of side effects of any steroid. Despite very low binding affinity with the androgen receptor, oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis.[citation needed] For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes. Many athletes also use <strong>oxymetholone</strong> as a method of protection for the joints under heavy loads. Due to the high water retention users experience from this drug, it similarly lubricates the joints and helps protect them from injury. Oxymetholone is widely considered by bodybuilders to have the strongest anabolic effect out of any <strong>oral steroid</strong> available.</p><h2>Anadrol Cycles</h2><p>While there are many cycles and stacks we can plan, quality Anadrol cycles are without question very hard to beat. Most commonly Anadrol cycles are run during off-season periods of growth as thesteroid is well-suited for rapidly building mass and increasing strength. Of course Anadrol cycles can be part of a cutting plan and very effectively so but as the vast majority supplement for off-season periods of use it will be this period we focus on here. As a powerful DHT based anabolic steroid Anadrol can rapidly increase size; it is not uncommon for increases in weight to reach 20-30lbs in mere weeks of use. Further, if that wasnt enough those who supplement with this steroid can expect to see their strength shoot through the roof; strength and size with full and well-rounded muscles, for many performance enhancers this is the end all be all. Of course before you plan any of your Anadrol cycles, although those are some amazing benefits that can be obtained youre going to need to know how to go about it. Contrary to popular culture belief you cannot simply supplement with anabolic steroids; you do not randomly pour a bottle of pills down your throat or arbitrarily jam a needle in your butt; there is planning, doses, length and what to stack.</p><h3>The Basics:</h3><p>Before you plan any Anadrol cycles there is one very important prerequisite that must be fulfilled; education. It is very important you familiarize yourself with the hormone; read and study various profiles and reviews and ensure you have a sound understanding of the hormones functions so as to eliminate any surprises later on down the road. Once the hormone is understood its actually time to start planning. In most all cases, most Anadrol cycles will run for 4-6 weeks of use at a dosing of 50mg per day; for most men there will never be a need to go over this amount. Luckily for you this steroid comes in 50mg tablets making supplementation very easy. Of course some will want more and doses as high as 100mg can be used but should only be used by very experienced and only when absolutely necessary. One should keep in mind the higher the dose goes the greater the risk of adverse side-effects will be; you may indeed get a little more out of 100mg per day but the odds of incurring adverse effects are not in your favor. Beyond 100mg is not advisable; not only is it very dangerous its actually pointless. Unlike many anabolic androgenic steroids Anadrol appears to hold to a sharp fall-off curve; simply put, a dose of say 150mg is not going to do much more than a dose of 100mg and will in-short be a waste of good Anadrol.</p><h3>Sample Anadrol Cycles:</h3><p>We have provided you four sample Anadrol cycles from which to choose; the first is for a fresh beginner, one is moderate, the third is somewhat advanced with the final cycle being for the far advanced anabolic steroid user. One of the first things you may have noticed is testosterone is included in each and every cycle and necessarily so. Like most all anabolic steroids Anadrol will greatly suppress your natural testosterone production and as you need testosterone and essentially so, it must be provided in exogenous form. In reality though the added testosterone is a benefit as this is the most important and beneficial anabolic steroid to begin with by far; in reality, testosterone is the foundation and Anadrol is the addition. Regardless of your level of experience one of these Anadrol cycles will more than likely meet your needs. It is however important to note, were not saying you cant plan your Anadrol cycles differently than what we have laid out here; weve simply provided you four sample Anadrol cycles that are highly efficient and effective but there are truly numerous options.</p><ul><li>Level 1: Week 1-4 Anadrol 50mg every day Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 500mg per week</li><li>Level 2: Week 1-6 Anadrol 50mg every day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 200mg per week Week 1-12 Testosterone-Cypionate 600mg per week</li><li>Level 3: Week 1-6 Anadrol 50mg per day Week 1-12 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-16 Testosterone-Enanthate 750mg per week</li><li>Level 4: Week 1-6 Anadrol 100mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-16 Testosterone-Cypionate or Enanthate 1,000mg per week Week 13-20Trenbolone-Acetate 75mg every other day Week 17-20 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg every other day</li></ul>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">50 mg/tab.

Originally developed in 1964 by Searle Laboratories, (absorbed by Pfizer in 2003)the same manufacturer who brought us other well-known items such as Celebrex, Ambien, Dramamine and NutraSweet, Oxandrolone hit the shelves under the trade name Anavar and has been a favorite of many ever since.

By design Anavar is a C17 alpha-alkylated (17-aa) anabolic steroid simply meaning the 17th carbon position has been altered in order to allow the medication to survive the first pass through the liver; without the 17-aa characteristic the medication would prove to be useless, as is common with most oral anabolic androgenic steroids. However, by its design <strong>Anavar</strong> is able to survive ingestion and enter into the blood stream where it becomes active and performs its varying functions within the body. As the 17-aa alteration is necessary for the hormones survival it is not without its disadvantages as this slight alteration is toxic to the liver; however, it is very<a class=""Bx7N5mg26q5r HA4TXHrH"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/anavar-oxandrolone/oxandrolone-tablets-our-product.html#25870006""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> to note the toxicity of a particular 17-aa steroid will vary from one to the next and in the case of Anavar we have a 17-aa of a very mild toxic nature. Anavar is so mild in-terms of liver toxicity most who supplement or medicate with the Oxandrolone hormone experience little to no increases in liver enzyme readings during their period of use and any elevation will generally return to normal once use is discontinued. As an oral anabolic steroid, once ingested Anavar becomes active within the blood very rapidly, as is a very common trait among most oral anabolic steroids and especially those who carry with them a DHT nature. While initial activity is very fast total active duration is consequently very short as Anavar only possesses a half-life of approximately 9 hours making frequent dosing a necessity. With a 9 hour half-life most will find a twice daily administration of the hormone to be optimal if peak levels of the hormone are to be maintained within the blood. No, twice daily administration is not an outright necessity, once daily can still provide many benefits and many women whose doses will be fairly low often opt for this route, as well as many clinical patients. However, it is when we enter the world of male performance enhancement that multiple dosing per day proves to be more efficient, especially when we consider most men require a large amount to reap any reward.</p><h3>The Benefits of Anavar:</h3><p>Perhaps the greatest benefit revolving around the <strong>Oxandrolone</strong> hormone is its ability to treat muscle wasting diseases such as aids as it will greatly stave off muscle disintegration that is both common with such ailments and often one that causes a devastating end. Anavar can also be very useful in the treatment of burn victims enabling them to regain lost tissue but in some cases it may prove to not be enough and stronger anabolics are needed. While its medical purposes remain very simple, in the world of performance enhancement <em>Anavar</em> is not so cut-and-dry; in-fact, for the male performance enhancer looking to bulk up in size this is perhaps the last option he should ever consider. No, Anavar will not provide massive piles of muscle but what gains in size it does provide will be pure lean tissue and if you understand anything about performance each pound of lean tissue is worth its weight in gold.<a class=""Bx7N5mg26q5r HA4TXHrH"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/anavar-oxandrolone/oxandrolone-tablets-our-product.html#83934223""> Even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> so, in the world of performance enhancement Anavar holds distinct qualities in both men and women but in many ways it is women who benefit the most, so much so in many circles it is often referred to as The Girl Steroid. Without question the greatest benefit to the <em>Oxandrolone steroid</em> is within its ability to preserve lean muscle tissue while simultaneously increasing total metabolic activity. With that in mind one can easily gather that during dieting or when intense activity is a regular basis this will be when the hormone proves to be the most useful. Anavar by its very nature greatly preserves lean tissue and as hard dieting often risk the loss of such tissue this trait is invaluable. Further and of equal importance, the Oxandrolone hormone actively increases metabolic efficiency, meaning the rate in-which we burn fat will be increased. These two primary effects prove to be very useful, especially when we consider them in total conjunction, for example:</p><ul><li>The more muscle tissue we have the greater our metabolism</li><li>Dieting risk the loss of muscle tissue</li><li>Anavar <strong>preserves muscle tissue</strong></li><li>We now hold more muscle tissue while dieting, thereby maintaining greater metabolism</li></ul><p>While Anavars metabolic and tissue preserving qualities are truly great, when we examine the hormone we can hardly say these are the greatest traits of all. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it is the hormones function within the female user that is such a welcomed one; so much so we will discuss it in detail in its own<a class=""Bx7N5mg26q5r HA4TXHrH"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/anavar-oxandrolone/oxandrolone-tablets-our-product.html#61015987""> section<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> below.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Anavar:</h3><p>Anabolic Androgenic Steroids carry with them the potential for negative or adverse side-effects, this much is true but when it comes to Anavar the potential is low, very low. It is important to understand, Potential does not mean guaranteed, it does not mean the likelihood is great; it simply means a possibility exists and this is the case with all medications of every nature; when you buy anything at your local RX, from cough syrup to Aspirin and everything in between there is a potential for negative side-effects. As it pertains to Anavar not only is this steroidal hormone very side-effect friendly, as is with most anabolic steroids side-effects are largely avoidable when responsible use is implored. As abuse or mega dosing often increases risk ones sensitivity to the hormone also plays a large role and this is true with all things in life; some people cant take Tylenol because it makes them sick, other take it every day; some people cant eat eggs or they become deathly ill, while others eat eggs every single day. When we look at the side-effects of anabolic steroids in general the first thing we notice is most are estrogenic in nature and this is due to the conversion of estrogen in the body brought on by the presence of the active hormone. If youre supplementing with Anavar there is good news, Anavar does not possess this trait, meaning, there is no estrogen conversion and such related <strong>side-effects are non-existent</strong>. Why is this<a class=""Bx7N5mg26q5r HA4TXHrH"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/anavar-oxandrolone/oxandrolone-tablets-our-product.html#57974534""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a>? Because there is no conversion process or what is better known as the aromatase process there is no risk in Gynecomastia, water retention, there are <strong>fewer risk in-terms of blood pressure and cholesterol and to top it off only a mild suppression of natural testosterone production</strong>. As we understand anabolic steroids suppress natural testosterone production, many suppress it to such a strong degree that its non-existent when the hormones are being used. Keep in mind, while Anavar does not suppress testosterone greatly it still suppresses it and if a man were to supplement with Anavar for the purpose of performance enhancement he will necessarily supplement with quite a bit thereby decreasing natural testosterone production quite handedly.</p><h3>Anavar and Women:</h3><p>The Girl Steroid is this really a true or fair name? Sure, men can supplement with Anavar and do so successfully but when we consider the limited nature of anabolic steroids women can use and how well they tolerate and respond to Anavar then absolutely The Girl Steroid is the perfect name. The majority of anabolic androgenic steroids have <strong>strong virilization effects when taken by women</strong> that can range from deepened vocal chords, body-hair growth and clitoral enlargement to name a few. Obviously these are not welcomed traits as they are in the face of a womans very femininity but with Anavar these traits simply do not exist when responsible use is implored; in-fact, most all women will find the steroid to be side-effect free. As it is so well-tolerated many female athletes around the world supplement with the hormone but unlike men many women have found a very suitable bulking agent in the Anavar hormone; while mild most women simply require a lessened boost if you will to see phenomenal gains. However, it is in the world of competitive physique sports that is perhaps this particular steroids greatest and most welcomed home, as it is not only a favorite but in many cases an outright necessity to the majority ofbodybuilding, figure, fitness and even many bikini competitors.</p><h3>Anavar Cycles and Doses:</h3><p>While Anavar will never be our primary recommended steroid for most men they can use it successfully and it can be quite useful especially when dieting; however, due to its mild nature most men will require a large amount and as it is one of the more expensive steroids on the market this can prove to be often inefficient. In any case, most men will find <strong>50mg per day</strong> to be the perfect starting point and in most cases this should be viewed as a minimum dosing but the majority of men will reap very little reward until they approach 80mg per day. Keep in mind, Anavar normally comes in 10mg tablets and often $2 per tablet is considered a good deal; as you can see, this can get very expensive. As we have discussed women are far more sensitive to the steroids attributes and therefore require far less; most women will find <strong>10mg per day to be the perfect dose</strong> and often all the Anavar they ever need with <strong>20mg being a good rule of thumb in-terms of maximal dose</strong>. While 20mg can be used safely we do not recommend you start there as while side-effects may indeed be very mild its always best to play it safe; besides, if you can get all you need out of 10mg then upping the dose proves to be pointless and simply a waste. In either case, both men and women, Anavar can be used for far longer than most oral anabolic steroids due to its low liver toxicity rating and further as it does not appear to taper off in benefit as fast as many other oral anabolic steroids. The majority of Anavar users will supplement for 6-8 weeks but longer durations of 12 weeks are not uncommon, especially during female contest preparation time. Keep in mind, the leaner you are the greater the results will be, meaning, they will be far more pronounced; for this reason most women will choose Anavar during the latter half of their diet to reap the greatest reward.</p><h2>Effects of Anavar</h2><p>Generally mild and relatively safe, the effects of Anavar are highly desired by many performance enhancers for those very reasons. Of course it remains, while generally understood by many the true effects of Anavar are often a mystery to most as most simply do not understand anabolic androgenic steroids in the first place. It is here we will clear up any confusion you may have so as to provide you with the means of proper and efficient supplementation. On that basis we will discuss the effects of Anavar, not in a specific hormonal structure sense, although we will touch on that briefly but more in-terms of practical application; after all, thats really the information you need and desire.</p><h3>General Understanding:</h3><p>The anabolic steroid Anavar is comprised of the active steroidal hormone Oxandrolone, a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived hormone of a C17-aa nature. Rapidly acting the effects of Anavar begin to manifest themselves very shortly after administration but as so rapidly acting the total duration of activity is approximately 9 hours; a very short half-life. For this reason most men who supplement will need multiple doses throughout the day, although women will normally suffice with one. By its nature the Oxandrolone hormone does not aromatize and as such any lean tissue built due to its use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue. While this remains true its primary role will far more largely revolve around tissue preservation and repair; this shouldnt be all that surprising as the hormone was originally intended for burn victims and those suffering from muscle wasting diseases. As such most men will find this to be a poor bulking agent and will find use more apt to dieting phases; while women will also see this steroid highly beneficial when dieting, as they are more sensitive it can have a larger positive effect during off-season training.</p><h3>Practical Effects of Anavar:</h3><p>The effects of Anavar will be most pronounced when used as part of the dieting or cutting process. In the grand scheme of action largely we can sum up the effects of Anavar with three words, greater metabolic efficiency. Through proper use the Oxandrolone hormone can provide the following:</p><ul><li>Greater Muscle Tissue Preservation</li><li>Enhanced Muscular &amp; Cellular Regeneration</li><li>Increased Rate of Lipolysis</li><li>Decreased Release of Glucocorticoid Hormones</li></ul><p>Of course traits such as increased nitrogen retention and protein synthesis will all be in play but the practical effects of Anavar can largely be summed up in the list above. In the end these effects lead to a leaner and harder physique and as most supplement for physique related purposes this can make Oxandrolone a fine choice.</p><h3>Dosing &amp; Duration:</h3><p>To maximize the effects of Anavar youre going to need the correct dose and time frame of use. Most women will find 10mg per day to be perfect with 6 weeks of continuous use to be more than sufficient. As for men things become a little trickier. As a very mild anabolic steroid and we do mean very mild, most men will need a fairly large dose to reap a reward if they are to truly take advantage of the effects of Anavar. Most men will find 50mg per day to be a solid dose with many going as high as 80mg per day. Generally 6-8 weeks of continuous use at the end of a cutting phase will be optimal. Of course as this is a very expensive steroid and one most men will use as part of a total stack this can get very expensive. In any case, man or woman, the Oxandrolone hormone can be a welcomed addition to a cycle and is worth strong consideration.</p><h2>Anavar Side-Effects</h2><p>When supplementing with anabolic steroids one of the primary concerns is adverse side-effects and necessarily so; after all, if you fall prey to serious problems this can make the benefits you receive rather pointless. Of course as there are hundreds of various anabolic steroids and there are significant differences with each and every one we cannot simply say steroids carry these side-effects; in actuality we must go even deeper. Each anabolic steroid will carry its own list of possible side-effects and while there will often be strong similarities there can also be a level of uniqueness. Further, it is important to understand possible means possible, not guaranteed and moreover we must consider the total rate of probability. We cannot say if you supplement with XYZ steroid youll suffer from 123 side-effects; there are issues to consider such as total dosing, individual response and even the potency of the steroid at hand. With all of this in mind we want to discuss Anavar side-effects. Oxandrolone is a very popular DHT derived anabolic steroid commonly sold under the trade name Anavar. A mild steroid but one that can be very beneficial, Anavar side-effects are also very mild and it is for this reason the steroid remains so popular. When examining Anavar side-effects we will find this is perhaps one of the friendliest anabolic steroids of all; perhaps the friendliest of all time; in-fact, even women can supplement with this steroid very safely and effectively. Lets take a look and see what we can find.</p><h3>Aromatase Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>Many anabolic steroids aromatize causing a buildup in estrogen throughout the body. This increase in estrogen is often responsible for many of the most common anabolic steroid related problems but in regards to the Oxandrolone hormone there is some very good news. Anavar side-effects of an aromatase nature are non-existent as this steroid will not aromatize at all. As it will not aromatize this makes Gynecomastia and water retention, two commonly feared side-effects impossible when the Oxandrolone hormone is in play. As aromatase will not occur protection that is often needed when other steroids are in play is not needed here; of course if youre supplementing with other steroids with your Anavar this can change things; here we are only concerned with the Oxandrolone hormone.</p><h3>Possible Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>As aromatase cannot occur this factor is moot but there are possible Anavar side-effects we must be aware of in order to protect ourselves. The good news is as a mild steroid most who supplement will have very little concern but as with all things we put into our body there is a possibility. While there is a possibility the probability of adverse Anavar side-effects is very low with responsible use; in-fact, the rate of probability is so low that most men who take high doses will not have any problems. Possible Anavar side-effects include:</p><ul><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>High Cholesterol</li><li>Hair-Loss</li><li>Acne</li></ul><p>Almost all who live a healthy lifestyle will never see their blood pressure or cholesterol change, not even slightly. As for hair-loss, only those who are genetically predisposed will carry this risk but as the hormone is so mild the odds will be in their favor. The same can be said of acne; only those who are predisposed to acne will have any problems and as a mild hormone its still a long shot.</p><h3>Female Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>The same Anavar side-effects discussed above are a possibility in women but in the case of the female athlete we must add to the list. The overall concern regarding females and anabolic steroid use is virilization as virilization can destroy a womans femininity. However, Oxandrolone in reasonable and responsible amounts will almost never cause this; in-fact, we can almost guarantee it. While this is true it must be stated; those who take large amounts do increase their risk. Further, there will be those who are simply extra sensitive and even at a low dose problems may arise. If you find you are one of the unlucky few you should discontinue use immediately. If you discontinue use at the very onset of virilization symptoms they will fade away quickly and no damage will be done. It is when the symptoms are ignored that problems will arise.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>As you can see this is a very mild steroid and while there are some Anavar side-effects worthy of note the list is rather simple and easy to control. Of course it is also important to note that while a mild steroid Oxandrolone will suppress your natural testosterone; for some reason over the years a myth has started stating this isnt so. Rest assured, while a mild steroid and one that does not suppress greatly, natural testosterone production will be suppressed none the less. In the end responsible use will always be our best friend and if you can hold to this we can assure you youll more than likely enjoy your experience.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

First produced in East Germany by Jenapharm, Turinabol’s existence was brought about purely for performance purposes; it was and is one of the few anabolic steroids that is only used in performance enhancement and has no purpose in the medical community. It was during the Cold-War era that the East Germans did all they could to promote victory in the Olympic Games by any means necessary and they were quite successful as one of the premier dominating forces and Turinabol among other anabolic steroids played a massive role in this outcome. Due to the success of this steroid in East Germany and the fact that it was undetectable at the time, the popularity of this steroid exploded and when one of the premier underground anabolic steroid labs came into existence, British Dragon with its own Turinabol product its popularity reached an all-time high. However, as it stands today you will not find T-bol as it is most commonly known in any human grade pharmacy form and very few labs carry it anymore; as you recall the original British Dragon is no more. Of the few labs who still manufacture the product you will find it to be a little on the pricy side.</p><h3>Turinabol:</h3><p>Turinabol is an oral 17-alpha-alkylated (17-aa) anabolic steroid that is more closely related toDianabol than any other steroid. A common thought is to compare Tbol to Anavar based on the types of gains but when we examine the steroid we find a bit of a different story. As you understand Dianabol is simply Methandrostenolone and Turinabol is Methandrostenolone with the added 4-chloro alteration. While there are strong similarities there are also some very distinctive differences making Tbol unique and a steroid worthy of discussion. An anabolic androgenic steroid <strong>Oral-Turinabol</strong> as it is officially known carries an androgenic ranking of 0 but nevertheless possess androgenic qualities as well as a nice anabolic ranking of 53. As a 17-aa anabolic steroid Turinabol is hepatic and liver enzymes will increase when the steroid is present; however, such existence is necessary in order for the steroid to function and survive. The 17-aa structural alteration simply means the steroid has been altered at the 17th carbon position in order for it to survive the first pass through the liver; without this change the hormone would be destroyed before it reached the blood and provided any advantage or benefit to the body.

Turinabol has the ability to reduce Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) thereby freeing more testosterone to be used at a higher rate of efficiency within the body. However, this steroid also by its nature carries a negative trait due to its fibrinolytic properties, meaning, it will greatly slow down the blood clotting process. When you couple this with the fact anabolic steroids increase hematocrit levels any cut you incur will bleed far longer than normal. As mentioned Turinabol carries some strong similarities in its make-up with <em>Dianabol</em> as it will increase strength and size but it is strength and performance for which it is more apt. Further, unlike Dianabol Tbol will not aromatize therefor giving it a higher level of toleration in many users.</p><h3>The Benefits of Turinabol:</h3><p>Turinabol can be a good anabolic steroid for generally any cycle; however, it will not produce near the amount of mass as many other steroids and to produce a large amount of mass an individual would need a fairly large amount and as Tbol is relatively expensive this isn’t always the best rout. However, it is<a class=""GOq3lxZ1I vSY5saJX53VC"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/turinabol/turinabol-tablets-our-product.html#21700845""> important<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> to note, by the way in-which Turinabol exist any increase in size will be exactly the size you want, pure muscle tissue. Make no mistake; we’re not saying Tbol is as poor of a mass builder as Primobolan, far from it but its positive properties will largely lie within increasing strength and athletic performance. As it pertains to enhancing athletic performance it really shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise; after all, this was the original intention of this anabolic steroid when it was brought to the market. How good is Turinabol at performing this task; well, a mere 10mg per day could give most any athlete a nice boost in speed but most will find a little more to be far more worth their while. While this steroid can be very beneficial to the performance athlete it can also have a positive effect for the bodybuilder in-terms of performance in that same light but the majority of competitive bodybuilders who supplement with Tbol will do so when dieting. You will rarely if ever find a competitive bodybuilder who supplements with Turinabol during his off-season period; as discussed this is not one of the better mass builders and mass is the primary focus for most bodybuilders during the off-season. It is during the dieting phase Tbol can be useful to the bodybuilder as it can aid him in <strong>maintaining strength</strong> while he is dieting and help him push through his workouts a little harder. However, this is not one of the more commonly used bodybuildingsteroids even in the dieting phase not simply because its availability is rather low but because there are so many other steroids that will serve this individuals purpose to much more efficient degree.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Turinabol:</h3><p>The most serious side-effect to Oral-Turinabol use is undoubtedly liver toxicity; those who supplement will find their enzyme levels to increase substantially when this steroid is in play and for this reason we will generally want to limit our use of the steroid to 6-8 week periods. It should be noted, while Turinabol is hepatic it is not nearly as toxic as many other oral anabolic steroids, such as Halotestin but nowhere near as liver friendly as say Anavar. However, once use is discontinued and assuming you are living a healthy lifestyle to begin with you will find your liver enzymes will return to normal very rapidly once use has been discontinued; of course this is assuming you are not supplementing with any other 17-aa <strong>anabolic androgenic steroids</strong>. Beyond liver toxicity the reports regarding side-effects of Tbol use are almost non-existent; that’s correct, this is one of the more well-tolerated anabolic steroids on the market. It should be noted, it can cause virilization symptoms in women but this is a topic that deserves a little extra attention.</p><h3>Turinabol &amp; Women:</h3><p>It’s hardly a secret, female use of anabolic androgenic steroids can be quite devastating to a woman’s femininity and for the female athlete<a class=""GOq3lxZ1I vSY5saJX53VC"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/turinabol/turinabol-tablets-our-product.html#70969547""> even<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> more caution must necessarily be applied if disaster is to be avoided. While there are many anabolic steroids in-which we have to choose from most women will find they are fairly limited if virilization is to be avoided as such an effect can strongly promote masculine characteristics. Generally milder steroids such as Anavar and Primobolan are a woman’s best friend, as they are both mild yet highly effective. As it pertains to<strong>Turinabol</strong> we have another steroid that can be used by women but more caution must be applied if it is to be used safely without a virilization effect and if such can be accomplished most women will find this particular steroid to be far more valuable to them than men. On a per milligram basis women tend to reap a higher reward than their counterparts but if virilization occurs it appears to do so at a faster and higher rate than many other steroids. Yes, women can use the steroid in a low dose and reap a very promising reward but the unpredictable<a class=""GOq3lxZ1I vSY5saJX53VC"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3d39; text-decoration: none;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise"" href=""https://www.steroids4u.to/turinabol/turinabol-tablets-our-product.html#43683157""> nature<img src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" alt="""" /></a> of the <strong>drug in-terms of virilization</strong> is often too much to risk and most women will find other steroids to be a far more well-suited option.</p><h3>Turinabol Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p><strong>For the athlete</strong> looking for an edge a <strong>dosing of 20mg per day</strong> will generally prove to be the minimal with 40mg per day being far more optimal. While <strong>40mg per day will provide a nice boost in-terms of overall athletic performance</strong> if you’re really looking to transform your physique you will probably need a far greater dose. As this steroid will not provide massive amounts of lean tissue most bodybuilders will not mess with it and if they do they will necessarily take massive amounts making it a poor choice for off-season periods of growth. The dieting bodybuilder however might find a more suitable use for the steroid but again there are more efficient choices for this individual. In either case, as it is an anabolic steroid that is hepatic total use should not extend past the 8 week mark but many will find 6 weeks to be just about perfect. <strong>For the female </strong>Turinabol user <strong>5mg per day would be the starting point with 10mg per day being the absolute max</strong>. Most females will need to start at 5mg per day to see how they react but understand if you approach the 10mg mark you will increase the probability of virilization.

there is truly nothing else quite like it! Originally brought to us by Ciba Pharmaceuticals, thanks to U.S. Olympic Team doctor John Zeigler, Dianabolor Dbol as it is commonly known was the first oral anabolic steroid ever created. While manyanabolic steroids were first synthesized with a therapeutic medical purpose in mind this is not the case with <strong>Dbol</strong>, in-fact, Dianabol was brought forth for one reason and one reason only, performance enhancement and with that in mind you better believe it held up to the desired end. For years the Soviet Union had dominated U.S. Olympic Teams through their use of testosterone and Dr. Ziegler was charged with coming up with an answer and his answer was one of the most powerful anabolic steroids ever created and to this day it remains so. Originally and to this day a favorite among competitive bodybuilders and power lifters for its ability to add massive amounts of raw size and strength, since its inception Dianabol has found a more than welcomed home in almost every athletic circle and just as its demand was high in the 1960s its demand remains high today if not higher.</p><h3>Dianabol:</h3><p>Highly anabolic with a moderate androgenic nature Dianabol is comprised of the active steroidal hormone <strong>Methandrostenolone</strong> yet generally carries the popular trade name Dianabol, as is common in the anabolic steroid world. Well-suited for gains in both strength and size, by its very nature Dianabol by way of action through the androgen receptors greatly and dramatically increases protein synthesis and glycogenolysis, much more so than most other anabolic steroids and at a much faster rate. An anabolic steroid that generally comes in an oral tablet form, it can be found in an oral liquid state and even as an injectable solution but both are rare and 99% of all Methandrostenolone will be in the oral tablet form. As is the nature of most oral anabolic steroid tablets Dianabol belongs to the class known as 17-aa or 17 Alpha-Alkylated. In this particular instance this means the Methandrostenolone steroid has been altered at the 17th carbon position in order to allow the steroid to survive the first pass through the liver after ingestion. Without the 17-aa alteration this steroid would be useless as it would be destroyed by the body before it could ever enter into the blood stream. However, as is with most 17-aa steroids Dianabol is toxic to the liver and while the level of toxicity will vary greatly from one oral steroid to the next in the case of Dbol we have one of the more potent and toxic anabolics in our hand; the most toxic, not even close but far more than most. While liver toxicity can be a big concern, with responsible use such concern can be eliminated; Dianabol has been shown to only be effective for short periods of time and while liver values may increase when use is in place they will almost always drop back down to their original state once use is discontinued. How bad or strong is this liver toxicity; we cannot give you an exact number as liver values will vary from person to person and dosing will also play a large role; however, we can say with certainty that 50mg of Dianabol a day is not as toxic as daily alcohol consumption and its not even close. Most who supplement with this steroid will find 6 weeks of use to be the maximal duration and highly efficient, as well as generally safe; use that extends past the 6 week mark will often be a waste as the body will no longer respond to the hormone and a break from use must take place.</p><h3>The Benefits of Dianabol:</h3><p>As Dianabol was designed specifically for athletes and performance it should come as no surprise that the benefits which may be reaped are perfect for just that; athletic performance. It is true, Dianabol is not the only steroid we can say this about but most anabolic steroids were developed to treat a particular disease or ailment and often performance is a secondary concern if at all and while other steroids may have performance in mind to a degree, as it pertains to Dianabol this was the only thing in mind. While <strong>Dianabol</strong> provides many benefits, in simple terms the most important of all is in its ability to provide a rapid increase in fat-free mass and that means pure lean muscle tissue. As you recall Dbol greatly increases protein synthesis, a trait shared by most all anabolic steroids only here it is more pronounced but it is in Dianabols ability to greatly increase glycogenolysis that really sets it apart. Again, in simple terms this increase in glycogenolysis means your carbohydrates become more valuable, each and every gram of carbohydrates is utilized to a higher degree when Methandrostenolone is present in the body, far beyond what it could ever be in its absence regardless of how well you eat. For this reason, especially in competitive bodybuilding circles Dbol has remained a staple for many off-season bulking cycles as carbohydrate intake is normally much higher in the off-season than it is when dieting. Not only is this factor important in-terms of size gains but as carbohydrates are raw energy, this is their primary responsibility, we greatly increase our raw energy and translate it into an increase in strength and often dramatically so. While these benefits are all truly great it does not end there; Dianabol further dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles of the body, as do most anabolic steroids but once again the rate in-which Dianabol pulls this off is nearly tenfold. From reading about these benefits the most obvious question is how truly great are they, can an actual number be provided that gives the above a little more weight? It is imperative to note, Dianabol will not cause a massive gain in size without enough fuel to perform the tasks at hand; however, even in a caloric deficit some increase in lean tissue and strength can occur. For those following a solid bulking diet and by solid we do not necessarily mean one that is massive, gains of 20-3olbs are not uncommon, in-fact theyre quite common with gains that surpass this mark while a little rarer not being unheard of. As is with most steroids Dianabol has one primary role but can serve more than one purpose, meaning in this case, yes, Dianabol can be used and used successfully when dieting and trying to lean out and this is not as uncommon as you might think. Competitive bodybuilders and power lifters will sometimes supplement with Dbol when dieting in order to maintain strength while in a caloric deficit; this can be very beneficial to a power lifter who needs to lose weight in-order to meet a desired weight class. Not only will dieting use of this steroid greatly aid in preserving strength but as often is the case it will greatly aid in preserving the tissue itself; as you can see, this is truly one amazing steroid.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Dianabol:</h3><p>All anabolic steroids carry with them the potential for adverse side-effects and like all things in life the extent of this potential and probability greatly varies from one steroid to the next. In Dianabol we have a very powerful steroid and as is common the more powerful the steroid the more potential there is for side-effects; its a tradeoff but keep in mind, potential side-effects in no way means guaranteed or assured. This is the case with any item you might buy at your local RX, each and every item carries with it the potential for side-effects, some more so than others and while some will experience negative side-effects from one item, lets say Tylenol, many others will not. However, while side-effects from varying medications can vary, when we compare and discuss hormones of a steroidal nature it is not always so cut and dry for with anabolic steroids more times than not side-effects can easily be avoided or protected against with responsible use, while with many over the counter (OTC) medications this is simply not true; in OTC meds you can either take it or you cant, end of story. As we discussed Dianabol is one of the more liver toxic steroids on the market but the effects of its action in-terms of increasing liver enzyme levels are 100% reversible, assuming responsible use is adhered to. While toxicity is indeed a concern that is hard to ignore, without question the greatest threat to Dbol use is high blood pressure; in-fact, of all the side-effects caused by <strong>anabolic steroids</strong>high blood pressure and Dianabol can often go hand-in-hand. If you suffer from preexisting high blood pressure you should not supplement with this steroid; theres simply no way around it and the simple truth is this steroid is not for you. However, for the healthy adult male, even at a high dose many will find blood pressure to be of very little concern; there is absolutely no way to predict if you will be one of the many lucky ones but a healthy diet rich in omega fats, low in saturated fats, with adequate yet not high sodium and low in sugar as well as with the use of an aromatase inhibitor can greatly aid you in this end. Other common side-effects associated with <em>Dianabol</em> include excess water retention andGynecomastia most notably and for this reason yet again an aromatase inhibitor is highly advised to control and prevent such effects. Keep in mind, as it pertains to water retention, as most will use this steroid while bulking if water retention occurs most will blame the brunt of it on the steroid and in many cases this is simply not true. Most simply overeat, particularly regarding their carbohydrate intake and as carbs cause you to hold excess water when they are consumed in abundance excess water retention exists. Further, if you are supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor in adequate and regular amounts and still suffering from high water retention you can guarantee you are simply overeating. As you can see, side-effects from this steroid are very easily controlled, however there is one more we must mention and this one is absolutely guaranteed. Dianabol will suppress your natural testosterone production and if you desire to keep an adequate <strong>level of testosterone</strong> in your system, as you should exogenous testosterone must be applied. This is however very good news, as both Dianabol and testosterone have been shown to work together in great synergy and with this added benefit any testosterone concern becomes no concern at all.</p><h3>Dianabol &amp; Anadrol:</h3><p>They are the two most common and popular oral steroids of all time and for the purpose of bulking there are few that can come close to the power of Dianabol and Anadrol. Both of these very powerful steroids are often discussed together and in many circles you will find fans of both and often fans of Anadrol will swear up and down it is the more powerful of the two; however, this is simply not true. On a milligram for milligram basis Dianabol is far stronger than Anadrol; in-fact, its not that close; yes, both are very powerful but Dianabol takes first prize handedly. This common misconception regarding the two steroids exists for one very simple reason and that is common dosing protocol. Most all cycles that include Anadrol will start at 50mg per day with 100mg per day being very common place, while conversely most <strong>Dianabol cycles</strong> will start at 20-30mg per day and while they often go up to 50mg in more hardcore circles, for the average gym rat it is rare. You rarely hear of anyone supplementing with 100mg of Dbol per day outside of elite level bodybuilding but if an individual were to take both steroids, one during the first cycle and the other in a second cycle and at equal doses in both, assuming both forms were of pure quality and all other variables remained the same the gains made from Dianabol would shadow Anadrol into the ground. In the end, while Dbol is more powerful you must find what works best for you, find which you tolerate to a higher degree, regardless of power your personal toleration is of the utmost importance.</p><h3>Dianabol Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For the majority of performance enhancers Dianabol will be used during an off-season bulking cycle; after all, by its nature it is primarily a bulking and strength increasing steroid; keep in mind, it can be used when cutting but bulking is where it truly shines. By its nature Dbol is a very fast acting steroid, so fast the effects can be seen in a matter of a few days; after a week there will be no question Dianabol is in your system and if you know anything about anabolic steroids then you understand this is very fast. However, as a fast acting steroid you may have already guessed it carries with it a very short half-life and youd be guessing right as this steroid carries with it a half-life of approximately<strong>5 hours</strong> making it one of the fastest acting and shortest lived anabolic androgenic steroids on the market. By this short half-life dosing of Dianabol should be multiple times per day reaching your total daily dose with the last dose spread out evenly throughout the day. It should come as no surprise, as this is a fast acting anabolic steroid many will choose Dianabol at the beginning of a cycle to kick the cycle off or what is often referred to as priming the cycle and while this is very effective and the most common place of use we must label another period of use superior. Dianabol is one of the best plateau busters on the market; with any cycle gains will come but at some point you will stagnate and changes must be made either in diet and training or in the anabolic stack; sometimes all three. However, in many cases if the individual simply added a little Dbol at the sticking point of the cycle they would see progress do just that, progress once again and if there is any place this steroid truly shines it is as a plateau buster while on cycle. The dosing of Dianabol can vary greatly but we can safely say to see any true anabolic affect <strong>20mg per day</strong> will prove to be the minimal dose with <strong>100mg per day</strong> being the maximal dose ever used and only used in certain circumstances by experienced steroid users. For the majority of performance enhancing athletes 50mg per day will prove to be all the Dbol they ever need and in some cases more than they need; if you are only looking for a slight bump in performance or size 50mg may indeed be too much. For the beginner most will find <strong>20-30mg per day</strong> to be all they need and in many cases all they ever want. There is one more factor we must discuss and this may be one of the most important of all and that is real Dianabol. Dianabol is one of the most common steroids on the black market, as its demand is very high and the raw powder from which it derives is one of the absolute cheapest to obtain. For those reasons you better believe there is a lot of under-dosed product on the market; demand is high and while powder is cheap most labs know suppliers are easily fooled and they will cut the tabs down to almost nothing and sell it to you at full price. It is somewhat rare for Dianabol to be outright counterfeited though, as powder is cheap theres not a lot of desire to counterfeit this product but in the name of greed it still occurs but it is low dosing that is the most common. Beware of where you purchase your Dianabol, always purchase human grade and always be aware of the laws as they pertain to where you live; follow these guidelines and youll save yourself a lot of trouble and enjoy one of the greatest steroids on earth.</p><h2>Dianabol Cycle</h2><p>The simple Dianabol cycle, while simple is one of the oldest and most popular anabolic steroid cycles of all time and for two simple reasons; it can produce amazing gains and rapidly so. Since its inception this little steroid pill has changed the face of athletics and physiques and while many othersteroids have come and gone Dbol as it is most commonly known has stood the test of time. When you stop and think about it this shouldn’t really come as a surprise; after all, the hormone was brought to the shelves for the strict purpose of athletic performance. This is worthy of note simply because most anabolic steroids were not first synthesized for performance enhancement purposes, although generally speaking most end up filling this role in a primary fashion. So what can a Dianabol cycle do for you? Let’s take a look and it’ll be easy to see why so many supplement with Dbol.</p><h3>Dianabol Cycle Benefits:</h3><p>Those who run a Dianabol cycle will most commonly do so during a period of off-season bulking. Yes, you can run a Dianabol cycle during your dieting phase and successfully so but due to the primary functions of the hormone it will best serve a gaining phase. Put simply the benefits of Dbol are increases in both muscle mass and strength. Individuals who supplement with this steroid can often gain as much as 20lbs in mere weeks, sometimes even more if enough calories are consumed. Further, many will see their strength shoot through the roof; even if calories are not that high ones strength will typically increase tremendously. When we break down the benefits of a Dianabol cycle more specifically one important trait the hormone carries is in its ability to dramatically increase glycogenolysis. An increase in glycogenolysis can be very important to an off-season athlete; put simply this means each gram of carbohydrates you consume becomes more valuable as they are used in a more efficient manner. In short, with this increase, as carbohydrates are a source of energy we are able to tap into and utilize our energy reserves more effectively; this effect is largely what causes the dramatic increase in strength.</p><h3>When to Run a Dianabol Cycle:</h3><p>Generally, in most cases a Dianabol cycle will take place the first few weeks of a total anabolic steroid cycle as part of a total stack; 4-6 weeks of use at the beginning of a cycle is very common place and very effective. The idea here is simply to kick start the cycle and provide gains and benefits quickly on the front end while the slower acting steroids are building in your system. This can be a very useful and beneficial period of use and while very beneficial there is another period of use that may be more important. A solid course of Dbol during the middle of a cycle can do some pretty amazing things as this hormone is an amazing plateau buster. As you understand hitting walls where gains stop is very common; even when steroids are used you will at some point hit this wall. This is where a solid Dianabol cycle can be game changing as it will help you bust through the wall with force if used during this period for that purpose.</p><h3>Sample Dianabol Cycle:</h3><p>When you plan your Dianabol cycle the most obvious question is how much do you need to take; after all, if you take too little what’s the point in taking it and you obviously don’t want to take too much and develop horrible problems. For the first time Dbol user there is no point in getting crazy; a moderate dose of 20mg-30mg per day will suffice and produce amazing results; in-fact, in many cases this will be all the Dianabol ever needed even for advanced athletes. Of course some will want more and generally speaking 50mg per day will be as high as anyone will ever need to go. Of course understand the higher the dose the greater risk of adverse side-effects and this will be something you need to keep an eye on. Now we’re not saying you cannot run more than 50mg per day, you’ll find there are quite a few people who do but in the name of safety this is not something we can advise. Regardless of how much you take most will find 6 weeks of total use to be just about perfect. Further, most will find extending use past 6 weeks to be pointless as gains will not be very strong past the 6 week mark of a Dianabol cycle. We have provided you some solid Dianabol cycle plans as examples; these are not cycles and stacks we’re advising you to implement yourself; they are simply common stacks that appear to be satisfactory by those who run them. The first is a moderate plan, the second for someone with a little time in the saddle and will be as far as most want to take it. We have however added one final Dianabol cycle to the list, one that is very far advanced and that will only be implemented by a very small fragment of the performance enhancement population as it is one serious stack.</p><ul><li>Basic Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 Dbol 25mg per day Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 500mg per week</li><li>Intermediate Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 30mg-50mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 750mg per week</li><li>Advanced Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 50mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin Week 1-10 Testosterone-Enanthate 1,000mg per week Week 11-14 Dianabol 50mg per day Week 11-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 75mg every other day Week 11-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg every other day</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dianabol Side-Effects</h2><p>If it’s an anabolic androgenic steroid it will carry possible adverse side-effects this is a given but it is also not so cut and dry. While there are many possible side-effects in-which we can discuss, here we want to focus on Dianabol side-effects and Dianabol side-effects only but before we do there are several things we must consider and bring to the table. There are numerous forms of anabolic androgenic steroids and each one carries its own list of possible side-effects; while there are often strong similarities there are also unique factors to eachsteroid. Further, we cannot simply say “XYZ” steroid will cause such and such adverse reactions; possible side-effects mean just that, “possible” and by no means implies guaranteed. We must look at what the possible side-effects are, what the probability of such an effect occurring is, what we can do to prevent them and what we can do to reverse them should they occur. These are all important factors that are often left ignored in anabolic steroid discussion and that is irresponsible. We must also take into account individual response. As we are all unique human beings certain things will affect all of us differently. For example, you may be able to drink ten glasses of milk a day but then another man, if he takes even a sip he becomes very ill. Different hormones, different medications and even different foods affect all of us a little differently; if you put it into your body there will be a reaction but if adverse reactions occur this will vary from person to person. With all of this in mind we want to take a look at the Methandrostenolone hormone commonly known as Dianabol or Dbol. When we look at the hormone we will find it is generally very well-tolerated among healthy adult men who supplement responsibly; while there are possible Dianabol side-effects the rate of probability appears to be very low in healthy adult men who supplement responsibly. Even so, you need to know what these effects may be and how to combat them and that is exactly what we want to discuss.</p><h3>Toxic Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Dianabol belongs to the C17-Alpha Alkylated (C17-aa) family of anabolic steroids thereby making it toxic to the liver. The reason for this nature is simply by the manner in-which the hormone exist. The C17-aa nature is a structural change, simply put the hormone is structurally altered at the 17th carbon position in-order for it to survive the first pass of the liver after ingestion; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver and completely useless in every way. Unfortunately this change in the hormones structure will cause liver enzymes to increase during use due to this toxic nature. Before you freak out there are some things you may be interested in knowing. You may or may not understand but most anything you put into your body of an oral steroid or non-steroidal medication is toxic to the liver due to the manner in-which it exist. Further, while possessing a strong hepatic nature the Dianabol hormone is not nearly as toxic to the liver as many common over the counter medications and is nowhere near as toxic as daily alcohol consumption. However, due this nature we must limit our use of this steroid to short periods of use, normally 4-6 weeks of total use each time the hormone is used to ensure our liver remains healthy. Although your liver enzyme levels will increase with use, if you are responsible with dosing and total duration of use they will return to normal very shortly after use is discontinued.</p><h3>Common Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>The most common Dianabol side-effects are largely due to the aromatase effect; simply put, the Dianabol hormone aromatizes causing a buildup of estrogen in the body. Make no mistake, estrogen is a very important hormone we need for proper function but too much can be very problematic. While this remains true we will also find these Dianabol side-effects to be very avoidable with proper use and while aromatizing plays a major role, other factors also can come into play with some of these Dianabol side-effects. The most common Dianabol side-effects include:</p><ul><li>Gynecomastia</li><li>Excess Water Retention</li><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>High LDL Cholesterol</li><li>Low HDL Cholesterol</li></ul><p>- Gynecomastia &amp; Water Retention: to combat these Dianabol side-effects we have two options, SERM’s or AI’s with AI’s being far more effective. SERM’s such as Nolvadex act by binding to the receptors in the place of estrogen thereby preventing Gynecomastia, however, if you’re a little more sensitive all the SERM’s in the world will do very little for you; further, SERM’s will do very little regarding water retention. With AI’s such as Letrozole the aromatase process is inhibited and total estrogen is even reduced quite substantially. This not only protects against Gynecomastia and water retention but all of the common Dianabol side-effects to a degree. Of course it must be noted as it is often neglected in conversation; many who suffer from excess water retention blame it on the Dbol when in-fact the true culprit is their diet. If you’re eating too much, especially excess carbohydrates you’re going to bloat and if you’re supplementing with Dianabol you’re really going to bloat and hold water. In many cases if the individual simply cut his carb consumption down he’d save himself a lot of unwanted stress. - High Blood Pressure: The Dianabol steroid can be one of the harsher regarding blood pressure. If you already suffer from high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid; if you are sensitive to incurring high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid. Regardless of your condition you’re going to want to keep an eye on your blood pressure when this steroid is used. Many will not have the first problem; in-fact, many will be able to supplement with all they want without problems at all but others may see increases. Keeping estrogen under control can greatly benefit you as can simply living a healthy lifestyle that is blood pressure friendly. - Cholesterol: To combat these Dianabol side-effects the absolute best thing you can do is to live a cholesterol friendly lifestyle and this means eating properly. There are many foods that have been proven to be very cholesterol friendly such as foods in the Omega Fatty Acid family. Those who consume plenty of such foods and keep their estrogen levels under control will have a far better Dianabol experience.</p><h3>Guaranteed Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Of all the Dianabol side-effects there are two that are 100% guaranteed and that is testosterone suppression and testicular atrophy and the latter is dependent on the former. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed and when production is suppressed, as testosterone is manufactured in the testicles our testicles atrophy. For this reason it is important to supplement with testosterone when we supplement with Dianabol, as testosterone is not only a beneficial hormone but one that is also essential to our overall health. When we provide our body with the testosterone it needs we will not suffer from any of the low testosterone symptoms; however, as we are not making our own testosterone our testicles will still lose a little of their fullness. While this remains true once all steroid use has come to an end the body will begin making its own testosterone again and our testicles will return to their normal size.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>In the end, while Dianabol side-effects are real they are largely avoidable and controllable with responsible use and part of responsible use is proper dosing but perhaps of an even greater importance is simply the manner in-which you live. Living a healthy lifestyle will do more for you than anything else and if you can do this as well as supplement properly, assuming you’re a healthy adult male you will have in most all cases an enjoyable and positive experience. Of course it’s always important to remember as we’re all very unique individuals even if you are a healthy adult male you may not respond to the hormone in as strong of a positive fashion as the man next to you; most will be fine and enjoy this steroids benefits but as with all things in life there are exceptions.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

Largely thanks to the massive media attention the drug has received over the years but more so due to the idea surrounding Winstrol as a Cutting steroid. Lets be clear, almost any anabolic steroid can be used to Cut or drop body-fat; the use of the words <strong>Cutting Steroids</strong> should only be taken with a grain of salt and that includes when talking about Winstrols.</p><h2>Overview of Effects</h2><p>Winstrol is an anabolic steroid with very low androgenic qualities yet highly anabolic. Its strengths lie within its ability to promote increases in strength, as well as harden an already lean physique. This hardening effect is what has led Winstrol to be known as a Cutting Steroid in many circles but make no mistake, Winstrol will not magically rip you to shreds; you must possess already low levels of body fat for it to give your body a harder more defined appearance. Yes, absolutely, Winstrol can help you achieve a lower body fat but all anabolic steroids can do this with just as much success. Winstrol is a long standing favorite of the bodybuilding world due to its hardening effects but somebodybuilders swear by it even in their off-season as a means to solidify gains or to increase strength during a cycle, thereby enabling them to push more weight and grow. However, although this is not the most common use of the drug it is also not recommended. Winstrol is one of the most toxic anabolic steroids to the liver and cycles of Winstrol are best run for short durations of six to eight weeks and not during Bulking cycles; save Winstrol for other purposes. Beyond the bodybuilding world <strong>Winstrol</strong> has firmly placed itself on the pedestal of most well-knownanabolics on the planet thanks to its use in professional sports by individuals in just about every professional sport imaginable. Winstrol as we discussed can greatly increase strength and this includes an increase in ones strength of speed. Further, due to its inability to promote massive gains in muscle tissue, it is a drug that can be used in low doses without generating a lot of suspicion. More importantly, Winstrol is only detectable for a very short period of time and is very, very easy to cover up if a drug test is made known to the athlete; these things make Winstrol a top choice for many professional athletes and for obvious reasons. It should be noted, the <strong>drug Winstrol</strong> and the <strong>drug Stanozolol</strong> are one in the same. <strong>Stanozolol is the official drug name</strong>. Many anabolic steroids carry a name based on the name of their original producer, for example the drug commonly known as Dianabol is specifically and more correctly known as Methandrostenolone; the same concepts applies here with Stanozolol or as you know it, Winstrol or Winstrol Depot.</p><h2>Effects of Winstrol</h2><p>Like all anabolic steroidal hormones the effects of Winstrol can be broken down into two distinct categories; the positive effects and adverse effects. By its nature, as we will see the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a stronger physique; such a trait can be perfect for an athlete looking for more strength and speed. Further, the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a better looking physique making it an excellent contest prep bodybuilding steroid and one for gym rats desiring a similar looking physique. Of course this steroid is not without fault as the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Such effects can range from common DHT related, to liver toxicity and of course natural testosterone suppression. Of course the hormone can be used safely and while some side-effects are indeed very genetically based revolving around individual response, most who supplement responsibly will have very few if any serious problems. Let’s take a look at the effects of Winstrol and discover how we can best maximize the effects within this DHT based steroid.</p><h3>The Positive Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Without question the primary positive effects of Winstrol revolve around strength and overall athletic performance; in-fact, it is athletic performance that has made this steroid so popular. This increase in strength can be translated into direct physical power, speed and simply a better performing athlete. No, the hormone will not create non-existing talent; it will simply enhance the talents already in place. Like all anabolic steroids the effects of Winstrol do not create an athlete, they simply enhance already existing athletic talent. Beyond performance athletics this steroid has a welcomed home in the physique inspired world as the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote this end. While a very poor mass building steroid the effects of Winstrol in this regard largely surround dieting phases. Winstrol is very apt for preserving lean tissue and strength when calories are restricted; ask any bodybuilder and he’ll assure you this is a more than welcomed trait. Further, by its nature the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a harder and more vascular look; key components to the physique game. Of course it must be noted this hormone will not make a fat physique ripped. To enjoy these physique enhancing qualities the athlete will need to be fairly lean to begin with if they are going to show; contrary to popular culture belief anabolic steroids are not magical.</p><h3>The Adverse Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Like all anabolic steroids the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Of course simply stating adverse reactions may occur is not enough, factors such as individual response, total dosing and time of use must be taken into consideration. For example, the higher the dose and the longer we supplement the greater potential there is for negative effects; this may sound obvious and perhaps over simplistic but these are factors many choose to ignore. What are the possible adverse effects of Winstrol use? A few of these are guaranteed, some are genetically dependent and one is very individual based on behavior. The effects of Winstrol in this category include:</p><ul><li>Cholesterol Issues: Winstrol can lower your HDL and increase your LDL. Those who already have cholesterol issues should avoid this steroid. Those who do not, who supplement responsibly and live a lifestyle that promotes healthy cholesterol levels will not have any problems.</li><li>Liver Toxicity: As a C17-aa anabolic steroid the effects of Winstrol include liver toxicity. This occurs due to the structural change associated with all C17-aa steroids. While unfortunate this structural change is necessary for the hormone to survive ingestion and administration. By this nature liver enzyme levels will increase when the hormone is used. However, if we are responsible in our supplementation, as the liver rejuvenates quickly enzyme levels will return to normal shortly after use is discontinued leaving no permanent damage. It is however highly advised you avoid heavy alcohol consumption when this hormone is in play.</li><li>Hair-Loss: As a DHT based anabolic steroid those predisposed to hair-loss may find they lose some hair with Winstrol supplementation. Those who are not predisposed will not lose the first hair on their head. Put simply, if you lose any hair you were going to lose it anyway; the Winstrol simply sped it up.</li><li>Acne: Another DHT based effect and again it will be of concern to those genetically predisposed. The majority of people will have no problem but if you are acne sensitive this steroid may cause breakouts. For this reason it is important you keep your skin very clean and always ensure your product is of a clean and pure nature.</li><li>Testosterone Suppression: For some reason many performance enhancers believe the effects of Winstrol do not include testosterone suppression; we assure you it does. For this reason you are highly encouraged to seek out remedy with exogenous testosterone use being your best bet.</li></ul><h2>Winstrol Cycle</h2><p>A Winstrol cycle is one of the most common anabolic steroid cycles of all. Somewhat mild in nature when compared to many other anabolic steroids this is a steroid well-suited for strengthening athletes in all sports and a very good bodybuilding contest prep hormone. While the basic Winstrol cycle has been part of sports for a very long time it reached new levels of popularity during the 1988 Summer Olympics when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, the hormone that makes Winstrol. While not the best bulking steroid for men a Winstrol cycle can be successfully run by female athletes in both bulking and dieting phases and as such is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be used safely by women. Regardless of sex or specific purpose of use a Winstrol cycle can provide fantastic gains to help you achieve your desired end. Let’s delve in and see what we can find.</p><h3>Injectable &amp; Tablet Forms:</h3><p>A solid Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) based anabolic hormone, Stanozolol can be commonly found in both injectable and tablet form. Regardless of the form you have the same Stanozolol hormone and your Winstrol cycle will be just as effective with either form. It is true that the injectable form is slightly more potent and on this basis some will always choose this form for their Winstrol cycle. Further, as a very liver toxic steroid due to its C17-aa nature many assume the injectable is a safer option. Let’s be clear, while slightly more potent in its injectable form the difference is negligible at best. As for liver toxicity, the injectable form of Stanozolol is also of a C17-aa nature just like the tablet; both forms are highly liver toxic. When you’re planning your Winstrol cycle the only thing that really matters is ensuring your product is of a high quality nature; beyond this the form does not matter.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Women:</h3><p>While anabolic steroid use can be very dangerous for women due to virilization effects, Winstrol remains one of the few choices females have at their disposal. Virilization symptoms appear to be much lower when supplementation is of a responsible nature but we must stress while the odds are in your favor virilization may still occur. If such symptoms begin to show the athlete should discontinue use immediately before they set in permanently. Most women will find a Winstrol cycle of 6 weeks in length to be sufficient at a dosing of 10mg every other day to every day depending on the athlete, desired end and response to the hormone. Some women may be able to tolerate as much as a 20mg dose but they should be forewarned that virilization will become a stronger reality. While a Winstrol cycle can be a solid option for the female athlete Anavar still remains our primary choice for female athletes.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Men:</h3><p>For the male Winstrol cycle, regardless of purpose of use 6-8 weeks of total use will normally suffice. For athletes looking for a boost in performance a dosing of 50mg every other day will in most all cases provide what they are looking for. Of course some will want more and if more is needed and this will be common in competitive bodybuilding circles or simply those looking for a similar physique a dose of 50mg every day can provide this end. As for doses of a higher nature, 100mg per day is the most Stanozolol any man will ever want to take and such a dose can only be recommended for very short periods of time. Such a case might be for a competitive bodybuilder right before his competition, say the last 10-14 days leading up to the show. In all cases most men will find this to be a poor mass building steroid as the very nature of Stanozolol will not readily promote this end. It can have bulking benefits due to its ability to increase synergy between other anabolic steroids but due to it being so toxic to the liver use should be limited to specific and most beneficial times. If one will save his Winstrol cycle for such phases of use he will most certainly find the hormone to be highly beneficial.</p><h2>Winstrol Pills</h2><p>Winstrol pills are one of the most common forms of the anabolic steroid hormone Stanozolol if for no other reason than their ease of use. While available in an injectable solution as well, in either case pill or injectable you have the same Stanozolol hormone at hand. While ease of use may make Winstrol pills more popular than the injectable form in many circles what truly makes this one of the most popular steroids of all time is simply by the way it functions. The Stanozolol hormone is not well-suited for building mass, in-fact, it won’t do much at all in this regard but the traits and benefits it will bring to the table are worth their weight in gold to most any performance enhancer.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills &amp; the Injectable Myth:</h3><p>It’s commonly understood that as a C17-aa anabolic steroid Winstrol pills are very toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is the truth. However, it is commonly believed that the injectable form commonly known as Winstrol Depot is not toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is a myth. The injectable form is also of a C17-aa nature, in-fact, you can actually administer the injectable form orally simply by drinking it. In both cases, Winstrol pills or Winstrol Depot you have the same Stanozolol hormone in a C17-aa form by-which is necessary for the hormones survival in the body. As such the total time of use should be limited and dosing should always be of a responsible level. If you can hold to this practice any effect the hormone has on your liver enzymes will not be of a permanent nature as the liver has amazing rejuvenating qualities.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills Dosing:</h3><p>Winstrol pills are most commonly found in 50mg and 10mg tablets. Regardless of the pills potency the same Stanozolol hormone is in each pill. Generally 10mg tablets will be perfect for female users as the average female dosing is 10mg per day. Some females may be able to tolerate 20mg per day for short periods of time but such a dosing can greatly increase the probability of virilization symptoms. Conversely most men will find 50mg Winstrol pills to be perfect for their needs as the average male Stanozolol dose is 50mg per day. If 50mg Winstrol pills are not available simply take the number of 10mg pills needed to meet your desired dose.</p><h3>Optimal Use:</h3><p>As a very poor bulking agent Winstrol pills will be best served when used in cutting cycles. During cutting cycles where calories are restricted the Stanozolol hormone will greatly promote tissue preservation and rejuvenation. Further, as a steroid apt towards strength, during a diet strength will be greatly preserved. Moreover, in the name of conditioning Winstrol pills will greatly promote a leaner and harder physique making this one of the more popular bodybuilding contest prep steroids. While cutting cycles are a fantastic use, Winstrol pills remain very popular in athletic circles for the purpose of simply enhancing overall athletic performance. Again, as increasing strength is this steroids greatest attribute and since strength is the end all be all for athletes this can be a fine choice. Further, as mass will not be built to a large degree and many athletes see mass as a hindrance in-terms of its effects on performance as well as the prying eyes it can invite this again makes Winstrol pills a fine choice.</p><h2>Winstrol Results</h2><p>You hear talk regarding anabolic steroids all the time but often it is in a very general sense. When most people talk about anabolic steroids visions of monstrous behemoths come to mind but what many fail to realize is that not all steroids meet this end. There are steroids that are far more suited towards building lean mass than others, there are steroids that will do more for strength and very little for mass; in the end, how big you get really boils down to how big you eat. For example, let’s examine the anabolic steroid Stanozolol commonly referred to by its most popular trade nameWinstrol. For those who supplement with this powerful DHT derived steroid Winstrol results while powerful will not translate into massive gains in size. Even in massive doses, which no one would recommend as such would be dangerous and pretty much a waste, Winstrol results will still not lead to the behemoth mentioned a few moments ago. For many this may be surprising; after all, most do not understand anabolic steroids but the truth is simple, each anabolic steroid is a little unique.</p><h3>Athletic Winstrol Results:</h3><p>The Stanozolol hormone has been very popular in the world of competitive sports for decades; we’re talking about everything from football to baseball and even track and field; in-fact, it is track and field that gave this steroid world renowned popularity. The reason is simple; Winstrol results in increased strength and increased speed in the athlete. This not only enables the athlete to train harder but garners him the ability to perform his desired sport at the highest level. To put it simply, while it may sound very simplistic it’s the easiest way to look at it; Winstrol results in a more effective and efficient athlete. No, it will not make a terrible athlete a great one; this is something many fail to understand about anabolic androgenic steroids in general; it will however allow and enable the athlete to perform at his or her peak potential of which cannot be obtained without.</p><h3>Primary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>When supplementing with this steroid the primary Winstrol results will be that of an increase in strength. Such an increase can be translated into direct physical power, the ability to move more weight and it can also be translated into more speed producing a faster athlete. As this is the primary trait it remains Stanozolol is one of the most popular anabolic steroids among performance athletes; so much so it finds its way into most any sport and in amounts that would probably blow your mind. It is true, while supplemental use of Winstrol results in very little mass increase some lean tissue may be gained but as this steroid does not aromatize each and every ounce gained will be that of pure lean muscle mass. With strength still being the primary trait dieting athletes, especially those of a physique nature may find this trait to be very beneficial. When we diet our strength generally declines as calories are restricted. When you diet you’re taking in fewer calories than you need to maintain your weight and often strength pays the price. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in such strength being greatly preserved as the hormone will aid in preserving lean muscle tissue. Of course the leaner we get the harder this will become but you can guarantee you’ll hold onto a lot more strength with this hormone in play than if not.</p><h3>Secondary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>In some ways lean tissue preservation could be placed in this category as strength is the primary trait but it also fits here. As we hold onto more lean tissue when dieting our metabolism is enhanced and as Winstrol results in a faster metabolism by the manner in-which the hormone performs in the body our metabolism is enhanced all the more. You may be thinking we’re putting too much emphasis on metabolism but for those who understand how difficult burning body-fat can be while trying to maintain lean tissue these people understand how invaluable metabolic related traits can be. Other secondary Winstrol results also fall into the dieting field. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in a harder and more defined physique and one that is more vascular to boot. This makes the Stanozolol hormone very popular in competitive bodybuilding circles as a lean, hard and vascular physique is the name of the game. We must stress and would be remised to leave this out; Winstrol will not magically turn a fat physique into a granite statue, you must already be somewhat lean to display these physique related traits. However, while that is true, if you are lean you will find Winstrol results in a much more impressive physique than a physique that is absent the hormone.</p><h2>Winstrol Side-Effects</h2><p>Moderately mild in nature, the hormone Stanozolol is one of the more popular anabolic steroidsamong avid performance enhancers; you know it best as Winstrol. Generally best served used in cutting cycles or as a direct athletic performance enhancer due to its ability to increases strength, while moderately mild Winstrol side-effects are very real indeed. While adverse Winstrol side-effects may occur they are by no means guaranteed. There are many factors that must be considered and if responsible use is implored you will find this is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be safely used by most any athlete. An anabolic steroid of the DHT class Stanozolol will not aromatize at all making common steroidal problems such as Gynecomastia and water retention of no concern; with that in mind, let’s take a look at the possible Winstrol side-effects and discover what we need to know.</p><h3>Severe Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Of all the possible adverse Winstrol side-effects issues surrounding cholesterol will prove to be the most serious of all. As you understand cholesterol is generally broken down into two categories, LDL, the bad cholesterol and HDL, the good cholesterol your body needs. The Stanozolol hormone can have a negative effect on both cholesterol readings and those who are predisposed to cholesterol issues or who already suffer from a poor condition should avoid this steroid like the plague. To combat these possible cholesterol issues we must keep our total dosing at a responsible level and limit the time of use to a responsible time frame. Further, following a diet that is cholesterol friendly will do more for you than anything else; those who fail to do so even when their Stanozolol use is of a responsible nature may find they fall prey to problems.</p><h3>Liver Related Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>It is generally commonly understood that the Stanozolol hormone is of a strong hepatic nature; simply put, of all the adverse Winstrol side-effects it remains liver toxicity is one of the most common. By its very existence the Stanozolol hormone belongs to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroidal hormones. This is classification is defined by a structural alteration to the hormone that allows it to survive ingestion; without such a structural change the hormone would be destroyed before any benefit could take place. While this structural change allows the hormone to survive its first pass through the liver it also makes it very toxic; it is a tradeoff and one that is unavoidable. It is a common misconception held by many performance enhancers that only the oral form of this hormone is hepatic in nature; this is an outright lie. Just as the oral form is C17-aa so is the injectable; in that there is no difference. When we supplement with this steroid our liver enzyme readings will go up; how much will be determined by total dosing and total time of use but they will go up none the less. For this reason, again, we must maintain a level of responsible use. For those who supplement in a responsible fashion there is some very good news. The liver has amazing rejuvenating capabilities and once use is discontinued, assuming the individual has been responsible liver enzyme levels will normalize and no permanent damage will be done. It should also be noted, during the course of use heavy alcohol consumption should be avoided; in-fact, laying off alcohol completely is probably not a bad idea.</p><h3>The Myth &amp; the Truth:</h3><p>One of the reasons Stanozolol remains so popular is because many believe Winstrol side-effects do not include testosterone suppression; how this myth started is unclear but it is a myth just the same. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production will be suppressed. Certain steroids will have a stronger effect in this regard but suppression will occur just the same. If you supplement with Winstrol your levels will fall and this is not only unhealthy but can be detrimental to your cause. For this reason some form of precaution is advised with exogenous testosterone use being your absolute best bet.</p><h3>DHT Based Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>As a DHT based anabolic hormone both hair-loss and acne can be a very real possibility; in-fact, these may be the most common Winstrol side-effects of all in-terms of visual effects. Assuring your product is clean and of a pure nature will greatly protect you from acne, as will keeping your skin extra clean; however, those who are genetically sensitive to acne may still have a problem. Those who are not genetically sensitive and who supplement with a pure product will in most all cases be fine. As for hair-loss, it is true, this is one of the primary Winstrol side-effects but it is not as cut and dry as you might think. Like acne, hair-loss is very genetically dependent. Those who are predisposed to male-pattern baldness run the greatest risk; men who are not should not lose the first hair on their head. If you are genetically predisposed to hair-loss, simply put you were going to lose some of your hair to begin with; the Stanozolol hormone simply caused this to occur sooner than it would have otherwise.</p><h2>Winstrol Stacking</h2><p>Winstrol stacking is very popular among many performance athletes as the Stanozolol hormone by-which it is comprised, is highly beneficial. In most cases Winstrol stacking will be reserved for cuttingcycles as this compound has very little use when it comes to trying to pack on size. Of course beyond cutting cycles many athletes simply use the hormone to enhance overall athletic performance; in-fact, this is one of its most common uses. However, it remains cutting cycles will be the most common point of use for Winstrol stacking as the majority of performance enhancers are physique based inspired; we’re not simply talking about bodybuilders but gym rats as well and they are the majority. We have broken down some Winstrol stacking examples for your benefit. We have provided you examples for both beginner and advanced use as well as male and female use. That is correct, Stanozolol is one of the very few anabolic steroids that can be used by women and as such Winstrol stacking is very popular among female athletes in a host of arenas. While all of this remains true our examples will be somewhat of a general nature as we cannot give you an example for each and every individual to meet their specific needs; however, for the brunt of you these Winstrol stacking plans will meet your needs to a tee.</p><h3>Female Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>While females can absolutely supplement with the Stanozolol hormone safely precaution must be applied. The general concern regarding anabolic steroids and females is virilization and fortunately Winstrol, while carrying a possibility will generally do so mildly. If a female supplements responsibly in most cases she will be fine but as we are all unique individuals, individual response will play a role. There will be some women who cannot touch this steroid even at a low dose and if problems begin to occur, you are urged to discontinue use. If you discontinue the moment problems arise they will dissipate and you will be fine. It is when these problems are ignored that they set in permanently. For most women 10mg every other day to even every day in some cases will be all the Stanozolol they need. However, some women will be able to tolerate as much as 20mg per day but this should only be tried by very experienced, very advanced and only in athletes who are in desperate need. Most women will never have a need to go above 10mg per day. We have provided two Winstrol stacking examples; a beginner to Stanozolol use and one who is more advanced with anabolic steroid cycling:</p><ol><li>Female Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/eod WK 7-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li><li>Female Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/ed WK 3-8 Primobolan Depot 100mg/wk WK 5-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li></ol><h3>Male Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>For the male athlete his Stanozolol use will fall in a bit of a different form; generally we will see use of this hormone at the back half of a cycle rather than early on in female use. Further, as it is a poor bulking choice for men, although it can benefit a woman during this time, for a man it will always be cutting cycle related. In many cases it is a bit inaccurate to label a particular steroid a bulker or a cutter but when it comes to male Stanozolol use we can make an exception; for male Stanozolol use this is a cutting steroid. The majority of men will find 50mg every day to be the perfect dosing for all their Winstrol stacking needs. Regardless of experience this will be our standard dose. Of course those who are looking for a slight anabolic bump to aid in athletic performance may only need this dose every other day and some may only need 25mg every other day; even so it remains 50mg every day will be our gold standard. Again, we have provided you two examples of Winstrol stacking, one for a beginner and one for an advanced anabolic steroid user:</p><ol><li>Male Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 400mg/wk WK 7-12 Winstrol 50mg/ed WK 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 400mg-500mg/wk</li><li>Male Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 200mg/eod WK 1-8 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 200mg-250mg/eod WK 9-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg/eod WK 9-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 100mg/eod</li></ol><p>*Note: Physique competitors may find bumping the Winstrol up to 100mg/ed the last 10-14 days to be beneficial but this would be the longest period and only reason for such use. Competitors may also find increasing the Trenbolone use to every day the last 10-14 days to be highly beneficial as well. **Note: Male Winstrol stacking examples have not included possible SERM’s, AI’s, Growth Hormone, or fat-burning agents such as Clenbuterol and Cytomel (T3) that may be highly beneficial as well; we have only focused on the steroidal part of the plan.</p><h4>***Abbreviations:</h4><p>- WK: Week - MG: Milligram - eod: Every other day - ed: Every day</p><h2>Winstrol Tablets</h2><p>Winstrol tablets are a popular form of the anabolic steroid known as Stanozolol; a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived steroid of immense popularity. Very popular among performance athletes in almost all sports its popularity is even larger among the millions upon millions of avid gym rats the world over. Of course you might think that’s an overstatement, hardly; in the U.S. alone over six-million American adults supplement with anabolic steroids for the purpose of performance enhancement and as Winstrol tablets are of a mild and generally of a tolerable nature you better believe millions are supplementing with them. To give you some understanding as to why so many supplement let’s take a look at Winstrol tablets and see what we can unveil.</p><h3>Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>A DHT based anabolic steroid, Winstrol tablets belong to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroids as well. The C17-aa classification refers to a structural change of the hormone at the 17th carbon position that is necessary to allow the hormones survival; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver. While necessary this structural change makes C17-aa steroids rather liver toxic; in the case of Winstrol tablets we have one of the most toxic of all. However do not let your heart be troubled yet; remember, even Tylenol is toxic to the liver and we must think in relative, realistic and responsible terms. The truth is simple; the liver possess amazing rejuvenation abilities and with responsible use, although liver enzyme levels will increase during use they will return to normal very quickly once use is discontinued; again, assuming use is of a responsible nature. If that’s not enough to ease your mind regular alcohol consumption of a heavy nature is far more toxic to the liver than Winstrol tablets and it’s safe to say a lot of you don’t think twice about it. Beyond its DHT and C17-aa nature Winstrol tablets carry an active half-life of approximately 9 hours making daily administration necessary if we are to maintain stable levels of the Stanozolol hormone. When we do the hormone will perform in a highly anabolic manner with very low androgenic activity. By its function Winstrol tablets greatly increase nitrogen retention in the muscles, increase protein synthesis and dramatically lower SHBG allowing more free-testosterone to be used by the body.</p><h3>When to Supplement with Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>By its nature Winstrol tablets are not powerful mass builders; in-fact, they will do very little to promote significant growth. However, some growth can be obtained, largely due to the lower SHBG factor and by the manner in-which Stanozolol creates synergy with other anabolic steroids being used. Further, as this steroid does not aromatize at all any weight gained due to use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue; it simply won’t be much and as it is so toxic to the liver use is best served for other purposes as other options are more efficient for bulking. Without question the two best times to supplement with Winstrol tablets is during a cutting cycle or a cycle designed to enhance overall athletic performance. To begin, Winstrol tablets will promote an increase in strength, as an athlete that is the name of the game; stronger and faster. It will not take a lot of this hormone to achieve this; most men will find doses of 25mg-50mg every other day to be all they need with most women only needing 10mg every other day. While enhancing athletic performance is a good use for this steroid it remains cutting cycles are the most common point of use as the majority of performance enhancers are enhancing simply to build a better physique. During a cutting cycle one will necessarily be consuming a restricted amount of calories in-order to burn fat. As calories are restricted losses of lean tissue and strength are sure to occur. Through supplemental use of the Stanozolol hormone we are able to preserve a great deal of our lean tissue and strength, thereby further enhancing our overall metabolic rate and burning even more fat. Moreover, by the manner in-which the hormone exist, when lean enough we will display a much harder and well-defined physique and for a physique minded individual there is not much more you can ask for. For this purpose most men will find a dose of 50mg every day to be more than sufficient with most women again only needing 10mg every other day, with daily doses being tolerated well in some specific cases.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>Whatever your purpose of use may be you’ll find Winstrol tablets to meet your needs and effectively so. Generally you’ll find the steroid to come in both 10mg and 50mg forms but you’ll also commonly find it available in a water base injectable solution known as Winstrol Depot. If you find the Deport version available to you nothing changes regarding what we have discussed here; it is the same DHT based Stanozolol hormone, it performs identically to Winstrol tablets and like the tablets is also a C17-aa anabolic steroid. In either case and for any purpose it is important to remember responsible use will always be your best friend.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

Originally developed in 1964 by Searle Laboratories, (absorbed by Pfizer in 2003)the same manufacturer who brought us other well-known items such as Celebrex, Ambien, Dramamine and NutraSweet, Oxandrolone hit the shelves under the trade name Anavar and has been a favorite of many ever since. While Anavar is not a very powerful steroid, milligram for milligram it is one of the weakest ever made, it holds the distinction as being the most side-effect friendly with the strong majority of effects being only of a positive nature.</p><h3>Anavar:</h3><p>A member of the Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) family, Anavar is comprised of the active hormone Oxandrolone and possesses only a very slight androgenic nature; so slight it is almost non-existent but it is with its mild anabolic nature that many find use for this particular hormone. By design Anavar is a C17 alpha-alkylated (17-aa) anabolic steroid simply meaning the 17th carbon position has been altered in order to allow the medication to survive the first pass through the liver; without the 17-aa characteristic the medication would prove to be useless, as is common with most oral anabolic androgenic steroids. However, by its design <strong>Anavar</strong> is able to survive ingestion and enter into the blood stream where it becomes active and performs its varying functions within the body. As the 17-aa alteration is necessary for the hormones survival it is not without its disadvantages as this slight alteration is toxic to the liver; however, it is very important to note the toxicity of a particular 17-aa steroid will vary from one to the next and in the case of Anavar we have a 17-aa of a very mild toxic nature. Anavar is so mild in-terms of liver toxicity most who supplement or medicate with the Oxandrolone hormone experience little to no increases in liver enzyme readings during their period of use and any elevation will generally return to normal once use is discontinued. As an oral anabolic steroid, once ingested Anavar becomes active within the blood very rapidly, as is a very common trait among most oral anabolic steroids and especially those who carry with them a DHT nature. While initial activity is very fast total active duration is consequently very short as Anavar only possesses a half-life of approximately 9 hours making frequent dosing a necessity. With a 9 hour half-life most will find a twice daily administration of the hormone to be optimal if peak levels of the hormone are to be maintained within the blood. No, twice daily administration is not an outright necessity, once daily can still provide many benefits and many women whose doses will be fairly low often opt for this route, as well as many clinical patients. However, it is when we enter the world of male performance enhancement that multiple dosing per day proves to be more efficient, especially when we consider most men require a large amount to reap any reward.</p><h3>The Benefits of Anavar:</h3><p>Perhaps the greatest benefit revolving around the <strong>Oxandrolone</strong> hormone is its ability to treat muscle wasting diseases such as aids as it will greatly stave off muscle disintegration that is both common with such ailments and often one that causes a devastating end. Anavar can also be very useful in the treatment of burn victims enabling them to regain lost tissue but in some cases it may prove to not be enough and stronger anabolics are needed. While its medical purposes remain very simple, in the world of performance enhancement <em>Anavar</em> is not so cut-and-dry; in-fact, for the male performance enhancer looking to bulk up in size this is perhaps the last option he should ever consider. No, Anavar will not provide massive piles of muscle but what gains in size it does provide will be pure lean tissue and if you understand anything about performance each pound of lean tissue is worth its weight in gold. Even so, in the world of performance enhancement Anavar holds distinct qualities in both men and women but in many ways it is women who benefit the most, so much so in many circles it is often referred to as The Girl Steroid. Without question the greatest benefit to the <em>Oxandrolone steroid</em> is within its ability to preserve lean muscle tissue while simultaneously increasing total metabolic activity. With that in mind one can easily gather that during dieting or when intense activity is a regular basis this will be when the hormone proves to be the most useful. Anavar by its very nature greatly preserves lean tissue and as hard dieting often risk the loss of such tissue this trait is invaluable. Further and of equal importance, the Oxandrolone hormone actively increases metabolic efficiency, meaning the rate in-which we burn fat will be increased. These two primary effects prove to be very useful, especially when we consider them in total conjunction, for example:</p><ul><li>The more muscle tissue we have the greater our metabolism</li><li>Dieting risk the loss of muscle tissue</li><li>Anavar <strong>preserves muscle tissue</strong></li><li>We now hold more muscle tissue while dieting, thereby maintaining greater metabolism</li></ul><p>While Anavars metabolic and tissue preserving qualities are truly great, when we examine the hormone we can hardly say these are the greatest traits of all. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it is the hormones function within the female user that is such a welcomed one; so much so we will discuss it in detail in its own section below.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Anavar:</h3><p>Anabolic Androgenic Steroids carry with them the potential for negative or adverse side-effects, this much is true but when it comes to Anavar the potential is low, very low. It is important to understand, Potential does not mean guaranteed, it does not mean the likelihood is great; it simply means a possibility exists and this is the case with all medications of every nature; when you buy anything at your local RX, from cough syrup to Aspirin and everything in between there is a potential for negative side-effects. As it pertains to Anavar not only is this steroidal hormone very side-effect friendly, as is with most anabolic steroids side-effects are largely avoidable when responsible use is implored. As abuse or mega dosing often increases risk ones sensitivity to the hormone also plays a large role and this is true with all things in life; some people cant take Tylenol because it makes them sick, other take it every day; some people cant eat eggs or they become deathly ill, while others eat eggs every single day. When we look at the side-effects of anabolic steroids in general the first thing we notice is most are estrogenic in nature and this is due to the conversion of estrogen in the body brought on by the presence of the active hormone. If youre supplementing with Anavar there is good news, Anavar does not possess this trait, meaning, there is no estrogen conversion and such related <strong>side-effects are non-existent</strong>. Why is this important? Because there is no conversion process or what is better known as the aromatase process there is no risk in Gynecomastia, water retention, there are <strong>fewer risk in-terms of blood pressure and cholesterol and to top it off only a mild suppression of natural testosterone production</strong>. As we understand anabolic steroids suppress natural testosterone production, many suppress it to such a strong degree that its non-existent when the hormones are being used. Keep in mind, while Anavar does not suppress testosterone greatly it still suppresses it and if a man were to supplement with Anavar for the purpose of performance enhancement he will necessarily supplement with quite a bit thereby decreasing natural testosterone production quite handedly.</p><h3>Anavar and Women:</h3><p>The Girl Steroid is this really a true or fair name? Sure, men can supplement with Anavar and do so successfully but when we consider the limited nature of anabolic steroids women can use and how well they tolerate and respond to Anavar then absolutely The Girl Steroid is the perfect name. The majority of anabolic androgenic steroids have <strong>strong virilization effects when taken by women</strong> that can range from deepened vocal chords, body-hair growth and clitoral enlargement to name a few. Obviously these are not welcomed traits as they are in the face of a womans very femininity but with Anavar these traits simply do not exist when responsible use is implored; in-fact, most all women will find the steroid to be side-effect free. As it is so well-tolerated many female athletes around the world supplement with the hormone but unlike men many women have found a very suitable bulking agent in the Anavar hormone; while mild most women simply require a lessened boost if you will to see phenomenal gains. However, it is in the world of competitive physique sports that is perhaps this particular steroids greatest and most welcomed home, as it is not only a favorite but in many cases an outright necessity to the majority ofbodybuilding, figure, fitness and even many bikini competitors.</p><h3>Anavar Cycles and Doses:</h3><p>While Anavar will never be our primary recommended steroid for most men they can use it successfully and it can be quite useful especially when dieting; however, due to its mild nature most men will require a large amount and as it is one of the more expensive steroids on the market this can prove to be often inefficient. In any case, most men will find <strong>50mg per day</strong> to be the perfect starting point and in most cases this should be viewed as a minimum dosing but the majority of men will reap very little reward until they approach 80mg per day. Keep in mind, Anavar normally comes in 10mg tablets and often $2 per tablet is considered a good deal; as you can see, this can get very expensive. As we have discussed women are far more sensitive to the steroids attributes and therefore require far less; most women will find <strong>10mg per day to be the perfect dose</strong> and often all the Anavar they ever need with <strong>20mg being a good rule of thumb in-terms of maximal dose</strong>. While 20mg can be used safely we do not recommend you start there as while side-effects may indeed be very mild its always best to play it safe; besides, if you can get all you need out of 10mg then upping the dose proves to be pointless and simply a waste. In either case, both men and women, Anavar can be used for far longer than most oral anabolic steroids due to its low liver toxicity rating and further as it does not appear to taper off in benefit as fast as many other oral anabolic steroids. The majority of Anavar users will supplement for 6-8 weeks but longer durations of 12 weeks are not uncommon, especially during female contest preparation time. Keep in mind, the leaner you are the greater the results will be, meaning, they will be far more pronounced; for this reason most women will choose Anavar during the latter half of their diet to reap the greatest reward.</p><h2>Effects of Anavar</h2><p>Generally mild and relatively safe, the effects of Anavar are highly desired by many performance enhancers for those very reasons. Of course it remains, while generally understood by many the true effects of Anavar are often a mystery to most as most simply do not understand anabolic androgenic steroids in the first place. It is here we will clear up any confusion you may have so as to provide you with the means of proper and efficient supplementation. On that basis we will discuss the effects of Anavar, not in a specific hormonal structure sense, although we will touch on that briefly but more in-terms of practical application; after all, thats really the information you need and desire.</p><h3>General Understanding:</h3><p>The anabolic steroid Anavar is comprised of the active steroidal hormone Oxandrolone, a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived hormone of a C17-aa nature. Rapidly acting the effects of Anavar begin to manifest themselves very shortly after administration but as so rapidly acting the total duration of activity is approximately 9 hours; a very short half-life. For this reason most men who supplement will need multiple doses throughout the day, although women will normally suffice with one. By its nature the Oxandrolone hormone does not aromatize and as such any lean tissue built due to its use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue. While this remains true its primary role will far more largely revolve around tissue preservation and repair; this shouldnt be all that surprising as the hormone was originally intended for burn victims and those suffering from muscle wasting diseases. As such most men will find this to be a poor bulking agent and will find use more apt to dieting phases; while women will also see this steroid highly beneficial when dieting, as they are more sensitive it can have a larger positive effect during off-season training.</p><h3>Practical Effects of Anavar:</h3><p>The effects of Anavar will be most pronounced when used as part of the dieting or cutting process. In the grand scheme of action largely we can sum up the effects of Anavar with three words, greater metabolic efficiency. Through proper use the Oxandrolone hormone can provide the following:</p><ul><li>Greater Muscle Tissue Preservation</li><li>Enhanced Muscular &amp; Cellular Regeneration</li><li>Increased Rate of Lipolysis</li><li>Decreased Release of Glucocorticoid Hormones</li></ul><p>Of course traits such as increased nitrogen retention and protein synthesis will all be in play but the practical effects of Anavar can largely be summed up in the list above. In the end these effects lead to a leaner and harder physique and as most supplement for physique related purposes this can make Oxandrolone a fine choice.</p><h3>Dosing &amp; Duration:</h3><p>To maximize the effects of Anavar youre going to need the correct dose and time frame of use. Most women will find 10mg per day to be perfect with 6 weeks of continuous use to be more than sufficient. As for men things become a little trickier. As a very mild anabolic steroid and we do mean very mild, most men will need a fairly large dose to reap a reward if they are to truly take advantage of the effects of Anavar. Most men will find 50mg per day to be a solid dose with many going as high as 80mg per day. Generally 6-8 weeks of continuous use at the end of a cutting phase will be optimal. Of course as this is a very expensive steroid and one most men will use as part of a total stack this can get very expensive. In any case, man or woman, the Oxandrolone hormone can be a welcomed addition to a cycle and is worth strong consideration.</p><h2>Anavar Side-Effects</h2><p>When supplementing with anabolic steroids one of the primary concerns is adverse side-effects and necessarily so; after all, if you fall prey to serious problems this can make the benefits you receive rather pointless. Of course as there are hundreds of various anabolic steroids and there are significant differences with each and every one we cannot simply say steroids carry these side-effects; in actuality we must go even deeper. Each anabolic steroid will carry its own list of possible side-effects and while there will often be strong similarities there can also be a level of uniqueness. Further, it is important to understand possible means possible, not guaranteed and moreover we must consider the total rate of probability. We cannot say if you supplement with XYZ steroid youll suffer from 123 side-effects; there are issues to consider such as total dosing, individual response and even the potency of the steroid at hand. With all of this in mind we want to discuss Anavar side-effects. Oxandrolone is a very popular DHT derived anabolic steroid commonly sold under the trade name Anavar. A mild steroid but one that can be very beneficial, Anavar side-effects are also very mild and it is for this reason the steroid remains so popular. When examining Anavar side-effects we will find this is perhaps one of the friendliest anabolic steroids of all; perhaps the friendliest of all time; in-fact, even women can supplement with this steroid very safely and effectively. Lets take a look and see what we can find.</p><h3>Aromatase Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>Many anabolic steroids aromatize causing a buildup in estrogen throughout the body. This increase in estrogen is often responsible for many of the most common anabolic steroid related problems but in regards to the Oxandrolone hormone there is some very good news. Anavar side-effects of an aromatase nature are non-existent as this steroid will not aromatize at all. As it will not aromatize this makes Gynecomastia and water retention, two commonly feared side-effects impossible when the Oxandrolone hormone is in play. As aromatase will not occur protection that is often needed when other steroids are in play is not needed here; of course if youre supplementing with other steroids with your Anavar this can change things; here we are only concerned with the Oxandrolone hormone.</p><h3>Possible Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>As aromatase cannot occur this factor is moot but there are possible Anavar side-effects we must be aware of in order to protect ourselves. The good news is as a mild steroid most who supplement will have very little concern but as with all things we put into our body there is a possibility. While there is a possibility the probability of adverse Anavar side-effects is very low with responsible use; in-fact, the rate of probability is so low that most men who take high doses will not have any problems. Possible Anavar side-effects include:</p><ul><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>High Cholesterol</li><li>Hair-Loss</li><li>Acne</li></ul><p>Almost all who live a healthy lifestyle will never see their blood pressure or cholesterol change, not even slightly. As for hair-loss, only those who are genetically predisposed will carry this risk but as the hormone is so mild the odds will be in their favor. The same can be said of acne; only those who are predisposed to acne will have any problems and as a mild hormone its still a long shot.</p><h3>Female Anavar Side-Effects:</h3><p>The same Anavar side-effects discussed above are a possibility in women but in the case of the female athlete we must add to the list. The overall concern regarding females and anabolic steroid use is virilization as virilization can destroy a womans femininity. However, Oxandrolone in reasonable and responsible amounts will almost never cause this; in-fact, we can almost guarantee it. While this is true it must be stated; those who take large amounts do increase their risk. Further, there will be those who are simply extra sensitive and even at a low dose problems may arise. If you find you are one of the unlucky few you should discontinue use immediately. If you discontinue use at the very onset of virilization symptoms they will fade away quickly and no damage will be done. It is when the symptoms are ignored that problems will arise.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>As you can see this is a very mild steroid and while there are some Anavar side-effects worthy of note the list is rather simple and easy to control. Of course it is also important to note that while a mild steroid Oxandrolone will suppress your natural testosterone; for some reason over the years a myth has started stating this isnt so. Rest assured, while a mild steroid and one that does not suppress greatly, natural testosterone production will be suppressed none the less. In the end responsible use will always be our best friend and if you can hold to this we can assure you youll more than likely enjoy your experience.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

First produced in East Germany by Jenapharm, Turinabol’s existence was brought about purely for performance purposes; it was and is one of the few anabolic steroids that is only used in performance enhancement and has no purpose in the medical community. It was during the Cold-War era that the East Germans did all they could to promote victory in the Olympic Games by any means necessary and they were quite successful as one of the premier dominating forces and Turinabol among other anabolic steroids played a massive role in this outcome. Due to the success of this steroid in East Germany and the fact that it was undetectable at the time, the popularity of this steroid exploded and when one of the premier underground anabolic steroid labs came into existence, British Dragon with its own Turinabol product its popularity reached an all-time high. However, as it stands today you will not find T-bol as it is most commonly known in any human grade pharmacy form and very few labs carry it anymore; as you recall the original British Dragon is no more. Of the few labs who still manufacture the product you will find it to be a little on the pricy side.</p><h3>Turinabol:</h3><p>Turinabol is an oral 17-alpha-alkylated (17-aa) anabolic steroid that is more closely related toDianabol than any other steroid. A common thought is to compare Tbol to Anavar based on the types of gains but when we examine the steroid we find a bit of a different story. As you understand Dianabol is simply Methandrostenolone and Turinabol is Methandrostenolone with the added 4-chloro alteration. While there are strong similarities there are also some very distinctive differences making Tbol unique and a steroid worthy of discussion. An anabolic androgenic steroid <strong>Oral-Turinabol</strong> as it is officially known carries an androgenic ranking of 0 but nevertheless possess androgenic qualities as well as a nice anabolic ranking of 53. As a 17-aa anabolic steroid Turinabol is hepatic and liver enzymes will increase when the steroid is present; however, such existence is necessary in order for the steroid to function and survive. The 17-aa structural alteration simply means the steroid has been altered at the 17th carbon position in order for it to survive the first pass through the liver; without this change the hormone would be destroyed before it reached the blood and provided any advantage or benefit to the body. As by its nature one of the primary functions of the hormonal compound is in its synergetic nature with other anabolic steroids. Turinabol has the ability to reduce Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) thereby freeing more testosterone to be used at a higher rate of efficiency within the body. However, this steroid also by its nature carries a negative trait due to its fibrinolytic properties, meaning, it will greatly slow down the blood clotting process. When you couple this with the fact anabolic steroids increase hematocrit levels any cut you incur will bleed far longer than normal. As mentioned Turinabol carries some strong similarities in its make-up with <em>Dianabol</em> as it will increase strength and size but it is strength and performance for which it is more apt. Further, unlike Dianabol Tbol will not aromatize therefor giving it a higher level of toleration in many users.</p><h3>The Benefits of Turinabol:</h3><p>Turinabol can be a good anabolic steroid for generally any cycle; however, it will not produce near the amount of mass as many other steroids and to produce a large amount of mass an individual would need a fairly large amount and as Tbol is relatively expensive this isn’t always the best rout. However, it is important to note, by the way in-which Turinabol exist any increase in size will be exactly the size you want, pure muscle tissue. Make no mistake; we’re not saying Tbol is as poor of a mass builder as Primobolan, far from it but its positive properties will largely lie within increasing strength and athletic performance. As it pertains to enhancing athletic performance it really shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise; after all, this was the original intention of this anabolic steroid when it was brought to the market. How good is Turinabol at performing this task; well, a mere 10mg per day could give most any athlete a nice boost in speed but most will find a little more to be far more worth their while. While this steroid can be very beneficial to the performance athlete it can also have a positive effect for the bodybuilder in-terms of performance in that same light but the majority of competitive bodybuilders who supplement with Tbol will do so when dieting. You will rarely if ever find a competitive bodybuilder who supplements with Turinabol during his off-season period; as discussed this is not one of the better mass builders and mass is the primary focus for most bodybuilders during the off-season. It is during the dieting phase Tbol can be useful to the bodybuilder as it can aid him in <strong>maintaining strength</strong> while he is dieting and help him push through his workouts a little harder. However, this is not one of the more commonly used bodybuildingsteroids even in the dieting phase not simply because its availability is rather low but because there are so many other steroids that will serve this individuals purpose to much more efficient degree.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Turinabol:</h3><p>The most serious side-effect to Oral-Turinabol use is undoubtedly liver toxicity; those who supplement will find their enzyme levels to increase substantially when this steroid is in play and for this reason we will generally want to limit our use of the steroid to 6-8 week periods. It should be noted, while Turinabol is hepatic it is not nearly as toxic as many other oral anabolic steroids, such as Halotestin but nowhere near as liver friendly as say Anavar. However, once use is discontinued and assuming you are living a healthy lifestyle to begin with you will find your liver enzymes will return to normal very rapidly once use has been discontinued; of course this is assuming you are not supplementing with any other 17-aa <strong>anabolic androgenic steroids</strong>. Beyond liver toxicity the reports regarding side-effects of Tbol use are almost non-existent; that’s correct, this is one of the more well-tolerated anabolic steroids on the market. It should be noted, it can cause virilization symptoms in women but this is a topic that deserves a little extra attention.</p><h3>Turinabol &amp; Women:</h3><p>It’s hardly a secret, female use of anabolic androgenic steroids can be quite devastating to a woman’s femininity and for the female athlete even more caution must necessarily be applied if disaster is to be avoided. While there are many anabolic steroids in-which we have to choose from most women will find they are fairly limited if virilization is to be avoided as such an effect can strongly promote masculine characteristics. Generally milder steroids such as Anavar and Primobolan are a woman’s best friend, as they are both mild yet highly effective. As it pertains to<strong>Turinabol</strong> we have another steroid that can be used by women but more caution must be applied if it is to be used safely without a virilization effect and if such can be accomplished most women will find this particular steroid to be far more valuable to them than men. On a per milligram basis women tend to reap a higher reward than their counterparts but if virilization occurs it appears to do so at a faster and higher rate than many other steroids. Yes, women can use the steroid in a low dose and reap a very promising reward but the unpredictable nature of the <strong>drug in-terms of virilization</strong> is often too much to risk and most women will find other steroids to be a far more well-suited option.</p><h3>Turinabol Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p><strong>For the athlete</strong> looking for an edge a <strong>dosing of 20mg per day</strong> will generally prove to be the minimal with 40mg per day being far more optimal. While <strong>40mg per day will provide a nice boost in-terms of overall athletic performance</strong> if you’re really looking to transform your physique you will probably need a far greater dose. As this steroid will not provide massive amounts of lean tissue most bodybuilders will not mess with it and if they do they will necessarily take massive amounts making it a poor choice for off-season periods of growth. The dieting bodybuilder however might find a more suitable use for the steroid but again there are more efficient choices for this individual. In either case, as it is an anabolic steroid that is hepatic total use should not extend past the 8 week mark but many will find 6 weeks to be just about perfect. <strong>For the female </strong>Turinabol user <strong>5mg per day would be the starting point with 10mg per day being the absolute max</strong>. Most females will need to start at 5mg per day to see how they react but understand if you approach the 10mg mark you will increase the probability of virilization. While 5mg per day may not sound like much it is important to remember on a per milligram basis Turinabol appears to be much stronger in women than it is in men meaning lower doses will have a far reaching and pronounced affect.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/cap.

Generally abulking steroid, as size promotion is its primary purpose it does possess secondary characteristics well-suited for cutting as well but only in very specific cases and for the average man this type of use will never be implored. As a powerful steroid most will find <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is best used during a bulking cycle at the front end as a kick start to the overall cycle. The most common practice is a 4-6 week run of <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> at a dosing of 50mg per day and for many this will be all the<strong>Oxymetholone</strong> they will ever need. However, for those who want a little more and these individuals always exist, 100g per day for the same time frame can be successfully administered but there are some important notes. It is important to understand how your body reacts to this steroid before you ever begin a 100mg dose; further, understand the possibility of negative side-effects increase dramatically when the dosing is increased. While 100mg a day will prove to be the maximum dosage that can be safely used, assuming the individual knows what they’re doing, beyond 100mg will often prove to be a waste as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong>has been shown to possess a fast diminishing rate when you go past the 100g mark. This simply means doses of 150mg or 200mg and beyond will not produce results greater than 100mg or at least at any noteworthy affect. The same can also be said of total duration; past the 6 week mark the benefits of <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>supplementation will begin to largely fade. While an individual may indeed pack on as much as 20-30lbs with the steroid the first 4-6 weeks such massive increases will not occur past the 6 week mark. As is with all anabolic steroids <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> does carry with it the possibility of negative adverse side-effects and with this steroid they can be very severe; especially when responsible use is thrown to the wind. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is one of the most hepatic oral steroids on the market; as a 17-aa steroid it is very toxic to the liver but while this is the case with all 17-aa steroids it is more so here. Granted, with responsible use liver damage will often be reversed when use is discontinued but this is assuming responsible sue was implored. Further, as it is well-known for, <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can greatly cause a massive buildup in water retention, so much so that for many the effect can be unbearable. For this reason the use of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is highly advised. Further, the use of an AI will aid in the prevention of Gynecomastia as well, another possible side-effect due to use. It is important to note, regarding water retention more often than not its unbearable nature is brought on by excess carbohydrate consumption. Excess carbohydrates will cause bloat, <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> will cause bloat; couple the two factors together and you often have a mess. Learn to control your eating and this problem can be largely avoided when responsible use is followed. As is easy to see, by its very nature <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> serves the primary role of increasing size, however, many competitive bodybuilders supplement with the steroid at the end of a contest prep cycle in order to fill out more efficiently. One must have a full understanding of the steroid to pull off such use without excess water retention being a problem but as the steroids effect on carbohydrate consumption is so pronounced it can have a positive effect when used properly for this purpose. Regardless of your purpose for use it is very important you ensure you are healthy enough for use to begin with. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can severely increase blood pressure and if your blood pressure is already high you cannot use this steroid and if you are predisposed to such a condition you are highly advised to stay away. As with most anabolic steroids supplemental testosterone is very important for the male users as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> will suppress natural testosterone production. For the female this is a steroid we cannot recommend as virilization can be very problematic when supplemental <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> is part of the female athlete’s plans.</p><h1>Anadrol</h1><h2>(Oxymetholone)</h2><p>We have so many anabolic steroids to choose from; some strong, some a little weaker and anabolicsteroids that serve every purpose imaginable but there is none more potent than that of <strong>Anadrol</strong>, was first developed in the 1960s by Syntex Pharmaceuticals as <strong>oxymetholone</strong> with means to treat muscle wasting diseases, osteoporosis and anemia. As should come as no surprise, being as this drug was developed to treat muscle wasting diseases it would soon find its way into the performance enhancing world, as is common. Anadrol is one of the most powerful anabolic steroids on the planet; as an <strong>oral steroid</strong> there is no stronger. As powerful as Anadrol is it is also one of the most problematic in terms of unwanted side-effects. As with all anabolic steroids there is always a risk to reward ratio and makes no exception.</p><h2>Why Anadrol?</h2><p>Anadrol greatly increases protein synthesis, a key element in gaining muscle mass; further attributes include its ability to dramatically increase red-blood cell counts in the individual; this is the reason it was developed in the fight against anemia. Anadrol also belongs to a class of steroids that can greatly increase water retention; please make a note of the word Can this is not the same as Will. Although <strong>Anadrol</strong> can greatly increase the amount of water youre holding in your body what many athletes fail to understand is that ones diet greatly affects the amount of water that is held. Many competitive bodybuilders use Anadrol as part of their contest preparations in order to give them a fuller look at the end and if you know anything about bodybuilding it is that water is the enemy when youre on stage. Some individuals will be more sensitive to water retention while using Anadrol some not but either way the punch this anabolic steroid packs is unlike any other. Most Anadrol users will use the drug as part of a stack in conjunction with other anabolic <strong>steroids</strong>. The most common administration of Anadrol is at the beginning of an anabolic steroid cycle the first four to six weeks. <em>Anadrol</em> is one of the more toxic oral <strong>steroids</strong> on the market and use much longer than six weeks is not recommended. However, most Anadrol users will only see substantial gains from the drug the first four to six weeks, so any longer is usually a waste. It is not uncommon for Anadrol users to gain as much as seven to ten pounds per week the first two weeks of use; generally the gains will slow down as the weeks continue. It cannot be stressed enough; a dramatic increase in weight such as this will not occur if one is not eating to fuel such a gain. Yes, weight will still be gained but it is largely dependent on the number of calories coming in.</p><h2>Side Effects of Anadrol</h2><p>Other common side-effects of Anadrol use include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Gynecomastia</li><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>Acne</li><li>Bloating</li></ul><p>Although these side-effects can be very nasty, they can also be avoidable. When using <strong>Anadrol</strong> it is highly recommended you use a good aromatase inhibitor such as Anastrozole (Arimidex) to ward of Gynecomastia. Issues such as bloating can usually be eliminated with careful diet planning, however, Anadrol is such a powerful drug sometimes water retention can settle in the lower back region and cause a very uncomfortable feeling. As for Acne, as it is with all anabolic <strong>steroids</strong> and is with Anadrol buy human grade and normally youll be fine; however, if you are more sensitive than average some acne may occur. The next question and perhaps the most common, who is Anadrol for in-terms of the performance enhancing world and the answer is simple; anyone looking for dramatic increases in strength and size will find this anabolic steroid to be for them. Granted, the side-effects are strong, the Back Pumps many attribute to Anadrol use can at times be unbearable but if you can handle it there isnt another anabolic steroid quite like it. Oxymetholone is one of the strongest androgenic steroid available.[citation needed] Similarly, it also poses the greatest risk of side effects of any steroid. Despite very low binding affinity with the androgen receptor, oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis.[citation needed] For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes. Many athletes also use <strong>oxymetholone</strong> as a method of protection for the joints under heavy loads. Due to the high water retention users experience from this drug, it similarly lubricates the joints and helps protect them from injury. Oxymetholone is widely considered by bodybuilders to have the strongest anabolic effect out of any <strong>oral steroid</strong> available.</p><h2>Anadrol Cycles</h2><p>While there are many cycles and stacks we can plan, quality Anadrol cycles are without question very hard to beat. Most commonly Anadrol cycles are run during off-season periods of growth as thesteroid is well-suited for rapidly building mass and increasing strength. Of course Anadrol cycles can be part of a cutting plan and very effectively so but as the vast majority supplement for off-season periods of use it will be this period we focus on here. As a powerful DHT based anabolic steroid Anadrol can rapidly increase size; it is not uncommon for increases in weight to reach 20-30lbs in mere weeks of use. Further, if that wasnt enough those who supplement with this steroid can expect to see their strength shoot through the roof; strength and size with full and well-rounded muscles, for many performance enhancers this is the end all be all. Of course before you plan any of your Anadrol cycles, although those are some amazing benefits that can be obtained youre going to need to know how to go about it. Contrary to popular culture belief you cannot simply supplement with anabolic steroids; you do not randomly pour a bottle of pills down your throat or arbitrarily jam a needle in your butt; there is planning, doses, length and what to stack.</p><h3>The Basics:</h3><p>Before you plan any Anadrol cycles there is one very important prerequisite that must be fulfilled; education. It is very important you familiarize yourself with the hormone; read and study various profiles and reviews and ensure you have a sound understanding of the hormones functions so as to eliminate any surprises later on down the road. Once the hormone is understood its actually time to start planning. In most all cases, most Anadrol cycles will run for 4-6 weeks of use at a dosing of 50mg per day; for most men there will never be a need to go over this amount. Luckily for you this steroid comes in 50mg tablets making supplementation very easy. Of course some will want more and doses as high as 100mg can be used but should only be used by very experienced and only when absolutely necessary. One should keep in mind the higher the dose goes the greater the risk of adverse side-effects will be; you may indeed get a little more out of 100mg per day but the odds of incurring adverse effects are not in your favor. Beyond 100mg is not advisable; not only is it very dangerous its actually pointless. Unlike many anabolic androgenic steroids Anadrol appears to hold to a sharp fall-off curve; simply put, a dose of say 150mg is not going to do much more than a dose of 100mg and will in-short be a waste of good Anadrol.</p><h3>Sample Anadrol Cycles:</h3><p>We have provided you four sample Anadrol cycles from which to choose; the first is for a fresh beginner, one is moderate, the third is somewhat advanced with the final cycle being for the far advanced anabolic steroid user. One of the first things you may have noticed is testosterone is included in each and every cycle and necessarily so. Like most all anabolic steroids Anadrol will greatly suppress your natural testosterone production and as you need testosterone and essentially so, it must be provided in exogenous form. In reality though the added testosterone is a benefit as this is the most important and beneficial anabolic steroid to begin with by far; in reality, testosterone is the foundation and Anadrol is the addition. Regardless of your level of experience one of these Anadrol cycles will more than likely meet your needs. It is however important to note, were not saying you cant plan your Anadrol cycles differently than what we have laid out here; weve simply provided you four sample Anadrol cycles that are highly efficient and effective but there are truly numerous options.</p><ul><li>Level 1: Week 1-4 Anadrol 50mg every day Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 500mg per week</li><li>Level 2: Week 1-6 Anadrol 50mg every day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 200mg per week Week 1-12 Testosterone-Cypionate 600mg per week</li><li>Level 3: Week 1-6 Anadrol 50mg per day Week 1-12 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-16 Testosterone-Enanthate 750mg per week</li><li>Level 4: Week 1-6 Anadrol 100mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-16 Testosterone-Cypionate or Enanthate 1,000mg per week Week 13-20Trenbolone-Acetate 75mg every other day Week 17-20 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg every other day</li></ul>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">50 mg/tab.

Cialis is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men. Cialis is also used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged. Adcirca, another brand of tadalafil, is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and improve exercise capacity in men and women. Cialis may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.</p><h2><strong>Important information about Cialis</strong></h2><p>Do not take Cialis if you are allergic to tadalafil, or if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems, including nitroglycerin(Nitro Dur, Nitrolingual, Nitrostat, Transderm Nitro, and others), isosorbide dinitrate (Dilatrate, Isordil, Isochron), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, ISMO, Monoket), or recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite (""poppers""). If you become dizzy or nauseated during sexual activity, or if you have pain, numbness, or tingling in your chest, arms, neck, or jaw, stop and call your doctor right away. You could be suffering from a serious side effect of this medicine. Do not take Cialis more than once a day. Allow 24 hours to pass between doses. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if your erection is painful or lasts longer than 4 hours. A prolonged erection (priapism) can damage the penis. Cialis can decrease blood flow to the optic nerve of the eye, causing sudden vision loss. This has occurred in a small number of people taking Cialis, most of whom also had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoke or are over 50 years old. It is not clear whether Cialis is the actual cause of vision loss. Stop using Cialis and get emergency medical help if you have sudden vision loss.</p><h2><strong>Before taking Cialis</strong></h2><p>Do not take Cialis if you are allergic to tadalafil. Cialis should not be used together with nitrate medication, such as nitroglycerin (Nitro Dur, Nitrolingual, Nitrostat, Transderm Nitro, and others), isosorbide dinitrate (Dilatrate, Isordil, Isochron), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, ISMO, Monoket), or recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite (""poppers""). Taking Cialis with a nitrate medicine for chest pain or heart problems can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure. If you have any of these other conditions, you may need a Cialis dose adjustment or special tests:</p><ul><li>heart disease or heart rhythm problems;</li><li>a recent heart attack (within the past 90 days);</li><li>a recent history (in the past 6 months) of a stroke, or congestive heart failure;</li><li>angina (chest pain), high or low blood pressure;</li><li>liver disease;</li><li>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</li><li>a blood cell disorder such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia;</li><li>a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia;</li><li>a stomach ulcer;</li><li>retinitis pigmentosa (an inherited condition of the eye);</li><li>a physical deformity of the penis (such as Peyronie's disease); or</li><li>if you have been told you should not have sexual intercourse for health reasons.</li></ul><p>Cialis can decrease blood flow to the optic nerve of the eye, causing sudden vision loss. This has occurred in a small number of people taking Cialis, most of whom also had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoke or are over 50 years old. It is not clear whether Cialis is the actual cause of vision loss. Stop using Cialis and get emergency medical help if you have sudden vision loss. FDA pregnancy category B. Cialis is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment. It is not known whether tadalafil passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2><strong>How should I take Cialis?</strong></h2><p>Take Cialis exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Cialis can be taken with or without food. Do not break or split a Cialis tablet. Swallow it whole. Cialis is usually taken only once per day. Follow your doctor's instructions. For erectile dysfunction, take the medicine just before sexual activity but not more than once per day. Cialis can help achieve an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill. Follow your doctor's instructions. Do not take Cialis for erectile dysfunction if you are taking Adcirca for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Do not take Cialis more than once a day. Allow 24 hours to pass between doses. If you take the medication daily, take it at the same time each day. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if your erection is painful or lasts longer than 4 hours. A prolonged erection (priapism) can damage the penis. Store Cialis at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2><strong>What happens if I miss a dose?</strong></h2><p>Since Cialis is used as needed, you are not likely to be on a dosing schedule. If you take tadalafil every day and you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2><strong>What happens if I overdose?</strong></h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Overdose symptoms may include chest pain, nausea, irregular heartbeat, and feeling light-headed or fainting.</p><h2><strong>What should I avoid while taking Cialis?</strong></h2><p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of Cialis. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with Cialis and lead to potentially dangerous effects. Discuss the use of grapefruit products with your doctor. Avoid using other medicines to treat erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil (Viagra) or vardenafil (Levitra) while you are taking Cialis.</p><h2><strong>Cialis side effects</strong></h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction to Cialis: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. If you become dizzy or nauseated during sexual activity, or if you have pain, numbness, or tingling in your chest, arms, neck, or jaw, stop and call your doctor right away. You could be having a serious side effect of Cialis. Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:</p><ul><li>changes in vision or sudden vision loss;</li><li>ringing in your ears, or sudden hearing loss;</li><li>chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling;</li><li>irregular heartbeat;</li><li>shortness of breath, swelling in your hands or feet;</li><li>seizure (convulsions);</li><li>feeling light-headed, fainting; or</li><li>penis erection that is painful or lasts 4 hours or longer.</li></ul><p>Less serious Cialis side effects may include:</p><ul><li>redness or warmth in your face, neck, or chest;</li><li>cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throat;</li><li>headache;</li><li>memory problems;</li><li>diarrhea, upset stomach; or</li><li>muscle pain, back pain.</li></ul><h2><strong>Cialis Dosing Information</strong></h2><p><strong>Usual Adult Dose of Cialis for Erectile Dysfunction:</strong> 10 mg orally taken prior to anticipated sexual activity. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients. Alternatively, 2.5 mg orally once daily, without regard to timing of sexual activity. May increase to 5 mg orally once daily based on efficacy and tolerability.</p><h2><strong>What other drugs will affect Cialis?</strong></h2><p>Before taking Cialis, tell your doctor about all other medicines you use, especially:</p><ul><li>rifabutin (Mycobutin), rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, Rifater, Rifamate), or rifapentine (Priftin);</li><li>an antibiotic such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin (E.E.S., EryPed, Ery-Tab, Erythrocin, Pediazole), or telithromycin (Ketek);</li><li>antifungal medication such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), miconazole (Oravig), or voriconazole (Vfend);</li><li>an antidepressant such as nefazodone;</li><li>a barbiturate such as phenobarbital (Solfoton);</li><li>drugs to treat high blood pressure or a prostate disorder, such as alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura), prazosin (Minipress), terazosin (Hytrin), tamsulosin (Flomax);</li><li>heart or blood pressure medication such as diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), nicardipine (Cardene), quinidine (Quin-G), or verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan);</li><li>HIV or AIDS medications such as darunavir (Prezista), efavirenz (Sustiva), etravirine (Intelence), nevirapine (Viramune), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), ritonavir (Norvir, Kaletra), and others; or</li><li>seizure medications such as carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Equetro, Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin), and others.</li></ul><p>This list is not complete and other drugs may interact with Cialis. Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products.

These people are happy to have found a pain killer that works effectively, while at the same time causing very minor side effects. Although this might seem well, and for the most part it is, the only issue is that not everyone has the proper self-control needed to stop using codeine once their serious pain problem has gone away. The serious pain problem a person might be suffering from will go away once they have received treatment dealing directly with the source of that pain. This is best done through a medical professional, but in some instances it may simply go away on its own. This would be the time to discontinue use of codeine. However, some people simply cannot do this, and the reason for this is because they have become too dependent. <strong>The way you feel when you are on Codeine</strong> When people are on codeine they are pain free for the most part, and this is a very good state to be in. When you are pain free you are comfortable, and this is going to cause a large amount of endorphins to be released into your body. Codeine is also responsible for helping to release a large amount of endorphins into the brain. The level of endorphins released is very similar to how many are released when a person is engaging in sexual intercourse. <strong>Codeine sensations similar to those of sex</strong> Believe it or not people who end up developing an addiction or a dependency on codeine are doing it not because they are trying to deal with pain. People are over using codeine because they cannot get enough of the sensations they feel when they are on it. These sensations can be even more powerful than those experienced during sex. In fact there are a lot of people who would prefer codeine or other forms of painkillers over sex. <strong>Strong senses of euphoria</strong> Because so many endorphins are being released into the brain by taking codeine, strong senses of euphoria are being created. This can cause a person to feel similar sensations to those who might be addicted to such drugs as heroin or meth. The two drugs I just mentioned are very hard-core and extremely difficult to get over. Those who do not discontinue use of codeine after their large scale pain problem has subsided are taking the risk of becoming dependent. <strong>The best way to protect against dependency</strong> In order to avoid the problems I just mentioned, it is going to be crucial that you discontinue use after your pain problems have subsided. Your physician is going to prescribe to you only the amount appropriate for helping you deal with pain. It is not meant to be a substitute for treatment of a serious underlying condition, nor is it meant to serve as an antidepressant. Do not let the alleviation of one problem give way to another. Use codeine to help you deal with a difficult situation, don’t let it be the cause of another one.</p>","<pre><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">30mg / 1 tab. (10tabs.)</span>

Sildenafil affects the reaction to sexual stimulation. It releases the smooth muscle with nitric oxide, a chemical that is normally released in response to sexual stimulation. Such smooth muscle relaxation allows increased blood flow in the penis, leading to erection. Sildenafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction (male impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension. <strong>Dosage:</strong> Kamagra Gold is taken approximately 30-60 minutes before sexual activity. Do not take a larger dose than one pill a day. Kamagra Gold is not an aphrodisiac, therefore, does not increase sex drive. Effects occur in combination with sexual stimulation.Consumption of meals with higher fat content may delay onset of action.While taking Kamagra Gold avoid drinking alcohol, grapefruit and grapefruit juice. <strong>Warnings:</strong> Not suitable for people who have had a heart attack, stroke, or if have high or low blood pressure. If you are allergic to sildenafil, notify your doctor or pharmacist. The elderly may be more sensitive to the side effects of this product. If you experience an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, seek medical attention. <strong>Contraindications:</strong> While taking Kamagra Gold, do not take other medicines to treat erectile dysfunction. Do not mix if you are taking medicines containing nitrates (medicines to treat angina pectoris). The product is not intended for women, children and patients with hypersensitivity to any component of the medication. <strong>Possible side effects:</strong> The most common effects include headache, flushing, heartburn, stomach upset, nasal congestion, dizziness, or diarrhea. The side effects are transient. In case you experience an allergic reaction, seek medical attention. Missed dose: Kamagra Gold is used as needed. There is no dosage schedule, so there are no missed doses. Exceeding the dose: If you think you have used too high a dose, seek medical attention. The symptoms of overdose usually include chest pain, nausea, irregular heartbeat, and feeling faint. Storage: Store at room temperature (20- 25oC). Protect from light and moisture.Do not store it in a humid environment.

Unlike hard-to-swallow tablets, Kamagra Jelly sachets can be simply squeezed out onto a spoon and swallowed easily. Kamagra Oral Jelly is manufactured clinically in clean room facilities by Ajanta Pharma. Kamagra Jelly is supplied in a range of flavours and quantities may include mint, chocolate, banana, orange, mango, strawberry, pineapple and vanilla. A selection of mixed flavours will be sent in every order. Unfortunately, we are unable to send specific flavours. Kamagra Jelly is quickly absorbed into the body and patients report faster response times from 20 mins. Kamagra Oral Jelly has an effective treatment time of 4 - 6 hours but many GPs report longer times. The active ingredient of Kamagra Oral Jelly is Sildenafil Citrate. It belongs to the PDE-5 family of vasodilators. These drugs work by dilating the blood vessels in the body; particularly around the genital area. This in turn, allows stronger blood flow to enable an erection to take place. Kamagra Jelly is not an aphrodisiac and stimulation will be required to develop an erection. To get the best from your treament, please read the following carefully. The safe indicated dose of Kamagra Oral Jelly within a 24 hour period is 100mg This medicine will become effective 1 hour after taking it and effects may be noticeable after 45mins Effective treatment time is 4 - 6 hours Always take this medicine with a large glass of water Avoid large or fatty meals close to when you intend to take the medicine Alcohol will reduce the effectiveness of this medicine. From time to time patients taking Kamagra Oral Jelly experience the following side effects. Common Side Effects Facial redness or flushing Headache Blocked nose Dryness in eyes Mild Nausea These common side effects are connected to dehydration and usually diminish by increasing water intake. Less Common Side Effects Slight blurred vision Slight blueness in vision Light sensitivity The above side effects are not dangerous and normally diminish as your body becomes accustomed to the treatment. Patients presenting with the above side effects generally do not need to stop taking Kamagra Oral Jelly. Serious Side Effects (Uncommon) Erection longer than 4 hours (Priapism) Severe decrease or loss of vision Severe decrease or loss of hearing Although serious side effects are rare, if you experience any the above serious side effects, stop taking this medicine and seek emergency medical care immediately.

<h1>Testosterone-Cypionate</h1>
<h3>(Testosterone)</h3>
In the United States it is the most commonly prescribed testosterone for the treatment of low testosterone, commonly referred to as Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) or Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT.) It is also one of the most popular performance enhancing steroids of all time the world over and if you’ve ever considered anabolic androgenic steroids there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Testosterone-Cypionate. As are all testosterone forms Testosterone-Cypionate is highly anabolic and androgenic with an anabolic and androgenic rating of 100 in each; in-fact, it is the anabolic and androgenic rating of testosterone by-which all anabolic androgenic steroids are measured. As Testosterone-Cypionate is just that, 100% pure testosterone, you will find it to be a perfect anabolic steroid for almost any purpose and one of the most efficiently well-tolerated anabolic hormones of all. As we look at this compound and try to gain an understanding you will find there are two key points of interest in gaining the knowledge you need; understanding the hormone testosterone itself and how the Cypionate ester that is attached affects it. By this understanding you will discover that all testosterone is virtually the same, as the hormone itself does not change due to the ester that is attached; the ester is not a hormone but rather a mechanism attached to the hormone that affects its activity and total action.
<h3>Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3>
Testosterone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce and it is a hormone all human beings naturally produce, both men and women. While men require nearly ten times the amount of women, in both sexes the hormone plays host to numerous responsibilities in the body that range from muscle tissue growth and preservation, metabolic and sexual function to a host of others all comprising of a well-functioning endocrine system. Many individuals the world over suffer from <strong>low levels of the testosterone hormone</strong>, the most common cause being age. As men age their natural testosterone levels decline but this effect can be seen in women as well, especially women who are post-menopause and <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate </strong>is often the means by-which it is remedied. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone he or she may experience a host of problems ranging from muscle and strength loss, a loss of libido and sexual function, increased body-fat, depression, a weakened immune system to a host of other ailments and conditions. In most cases such conditions are easily treated by simply supplementing with a testosterone based hormone and by simply returning levels to a stable yet normal level will in most cases see such conditions resolved. In a strong sense we can look at TRT therapy in a similar light when examining performance enhancement, the difference simply being taking our testosterone levels beyond the normal range, thereby enhancing the effects of the hormone even more so. For the majority of performance enhancers this will revolve around muscle growth and preservation, increasing strength and overall athletic performance as well as <strong>improving metabolic activity within the body</strong>. <em>Testosterone-Cypionate</em> use is one of the best methods of achieving such goals as its direct mode of action simply promotes their enhancement. As is caused by the presence of testosterone the hormone dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis and further enhances red blood cells by increasing the amount and structural capacity. Testosterone also has the ability to block and reduce glucocorticoid hormones in the body, also known as muscle wasting hormones; the most famous of all being cortisol. These hormones, often referred to as “<strong>stress hormones</strong>” can have disastrous effects as they destroy muscle tissue and promote fat gain, all leading to slower metabolic activity and making fat-loss more difficult than it needs to be. Further and of particular interest, when the testosterone hormone is present in levels beyond therapeutic measure our natural IGF-1 levels increase and as IGF-1 is a powerful anabolic hormone itself, a hormone that plays a key role within every cell of the body, our total activity in both an anabolic and metabolic nature increases yet again. Now that you have an understanding of testosterone the obvious point of interest is how does the Cypionate ester play a role and function. The ester of the steroid is largely what determines the steroids half-life and the larger the ester the longer the half-life will be. The ester attached also affects a particular steroids initial activity but and while not of particular great importance it also affects the compounds total mass. The larger the ester the more mass it takes up in the compound; for example,<strong>100mg of testosterone with no ester attached is simply 100mg of testosterone whereas 100mg of testosterone with an ester attached will be a little less than 100mg of actual hormone</strong>; how much less will be determined by the size of the ester. In the case of Testosterone-Cypionate we have a compound that carries with it a moderately long half-life as Cypionate is a fairly large ester; the half-life of Testosterone-Cypionate is approximately 12 days long. As a long ester based anabolic steroid the effects of the compound will not be felt very fast but the total activity will stretch past much further than smaller ester based forms such as Testosterone-Propionate. To understand how the half-life works is fairly simple; <strong>when we inject 200mg of testosterone Cypionate, a very common dose per injection for any purpose, 12 days past this injection 100mg of active testosterone will be left in the body; as another 12 days passes 50mg of active testosterone will be left in the body and so on until no testosterone is left</strong>; this of course does not take into account further injections that may occur but is based on one injection so that understanding may be gained.
<h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3>
It should be at this stage fairly easy to see the benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate and it doesn’t take a genius to see they are almost everything anyone could ever want out of anabolic steroid use. A common benefit often overlooked is the testosterone hormone’s <strong>ability to increase metabolic activity and in-truth this may be one of the greatest benefits of all and for all users of all purposes</strong>. For the HRT patient it allows him to garner a healthier physique pure and simple. For the performance enhancer it not only allows him to garner a more pleasing physique but one that is more efficient in nature; the higher our metabolic activity the more efficient our body becomes in most all aspects. Of course often the principle reason of supplemental testosterone use is to increase mass, strength and athletic performance and Testosterone-Cypionate will aid in every aspect and do so remarkably well; however, there are important things to understand. If you’re basing your understanding of Testosterone-Cypionate on popular culture references regarding anabolic steroids then all you need to do is grab a bottle, fill a syringe, inject and watch the show start; sorry, it doesn’t quite work this way. If you are after a true performance enhancing edge you still have to feed the body properly with adequate amounts of food and physical stimulation; through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate we simply enhance these aspects and increase the efficiency. For the TRT patient this might be a relief, for many TRT patients are petrified of testosterone therapy because they assume they’ll turn into the Incredible Hulk; if you do not feed and stimulate properly and in adequate amounts you have nothing to fear; further, HRT doses are typically too low to really do anything in this regard even if you do.
<h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3>
When examining the side-effects of Testosterone-Cypionate or any testosterone there is some good news right from the start; as testosterone is not a foreign substance it is not a hormone our bodies are unaccustomed to; you’ve been producing it at some level your entire life. Even so, when we enter into our body anything of an exogenous nature there is a potential for negative side-effects and the level of potential can vary with each and every item. The same can be said of all anabolic androgenic steroids, the level of potential varies with each and every one; nevertheless, while there is potential the probability is much lower than with many common over the counter medications, especially when we look at testosterone. Testosterone in many ways shouldn’t really be viewed as a drug, it doesn’t share any traits with what we use to determine if something is a drug and it’s not, it’s a hormone and there is a big, big difference. For healthy adult men most all will find that Testosterone-Cypionate is very well-tolerated when used responsibly; in-fact, numerous studies including those done by the New England Journal of Medicine have shown that even in supraphysiological doses the testosterone hormone can be used safely and without side-effects. While responsible use will always be best some individuals may find side-effects to occur and such side-effects caused by Testosterone-Cypionate will be of an estrogenic nature. Testosterone converts to estrogen once present in the body due to the aromatase process and by the buildup of estrogen problems such as <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues can occur</strong>. While these can be very problematic many individuals will never have to take note of them while just as many will but fortunately we can easily do something about it. While total dose will play a large role so will individual sensitivity but in either case anti-estrogen medications can prove to be invaluable here; most notably and with the greatest authority aromatase inhibitors (AI’s.) An AI actively inhibits the aromatase process as well as reduces the amount of estrogen in your body; understand what doesn’t exist cannot convert and what cannot convert cannot lead to a negative effect. There is another side-effect we must mention and it is one that will affect every man; testicular atrophy. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids, including testosterone our natural testosterone production is suppressed and as testosterone is produced in the testicles, when this production is in decline the testicles shrink. However, through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate this is of no physical concern as our body is being supplied with all the testosterone it needs. Further, testicular atrophy does not imply shriveled up raisins, it simply means the total mass will be a little less and anyone who has ever supplemented with Testosterone-Cypionate before can tell you it’s really not that big of a deal. Most importantly, when use is discontinued the testicles will return to their normal size; as no exogenous hormones of an anabolic steroidal nature are entering the body natural testosterone production will begin again. However, this will generally prove to be useless information to the TRT patient as he will more than likely be on continuous <strong>testosterone therapy</strong> for the remainder of his life.
<h3>Testosterone-Cypionate vs. Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3>
They are the two most commonly used Testosterones in both performance enhancement and TRT and two of the most commonly used anabolic steroids of all kinds the world over; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate. For years, decades even there has been a constant back and forth argument on which one is better and you will find individuals on both sides of the fence who swear up and down they are right; so the question is, which one is it? The answer, neither; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate are almost identical in every single way, so closely related that any difference is of such an insignificant nature that the users could not possibly benefit more or less from one or the other. Look at it like this; you have two sandwiches made by the same person with the same ingredients, one was made right now and the other 32 seconds before; one comes with a pickle on the side; which sandwich is better? To give you a more specific understanding both are pure testosterone, both are attached to large esters and while <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate most commonly comes dosed at 200mg/ml</strong> and<strong>Testosterone-Enanthate most commonly comes dosed at 250mg/ml</strong> the individual can easily adjust the amounts to receive identical dosing with each. The only difference here lies within the half-life of each; recall, Testosterone-Cypionate carries with it a half-life of approximately 12 days while Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it a half-life of approximately 36 hours less; when we’re extending past a week in total half-life with only 36 hours difference this is meaningless. The truth is simple; the same dosing of each testosterone compound will produce identical results.
<h3>Testosterone-Cypionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3>
Regardless of your purpose be it performance enhancement, TRT or a full blown HRT program you will be very hard pressed to find a better testosterone than Testosterone-Cypionate. In the world of TRT most will find 200mg every 7-10 days to be fairly common place and generally speaking about as high as you’ll ever go but of course in performance enhancing doses will necessarily be much higher. For the performance enhancer minimal dosing will generally be in the <strong>400mg-500mg per week</strong> range and most commonly split into two even doses twice per week; for example, for <strong>400mg total per week</strong> you might administer the hormone at 200mg on Monday and 200mg on Thursday continuing such a schedule until your total duration is complete. For many <strong>500mg per week</strong> will be as high as they ever need to go but in more hardcore circles it is not uncommon for doses to reach levels of <strong>1,000mg per week</strong> and at extreme elite levels, especially in competitive bodybuilding they can go much higher. Keep in mind, while the benefits of use will increase as the dose does so will the potential and probability of adverse effects. There is a strong risk to reward ratio at play and in the end you are the only one who can determine how far you want to go with that. Yes, absolutely anabolic steroids and especially those of a pure testosterone nature such as Testosterone-Cypionate can be used safely and effectively but responsible use will always prove to be the ultimate key. Part of responsible use will always include what is known as a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan in order to normalize the body after use has been discontinued. Recall, the use of such hormones as Testosterone-Cypionate will suppress natural testosterone production but natural production will begin again once use is discontinued; however, such production will not begin instantly and there are things we can do to speed up the process. The sooner we get our natural production back up and running the more progress we made through our anabolic steroid use will be kept but most importantly our overall health will be protected; recall yet again, testosterone is essential to our health. This is where a good PCT plan comes in and it is by this plan we can stimulate natural production to begin; common supplemental items often include SERM’s such as Nolvadex andClomid as well as the hormone hCG.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre>

<h1><strong>GHRP 6 – 5 MG</strong></h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
GHRP-6 peptide which is structurally very similar to its predecessor, GHRP-second The main difference is that the GHRP-6 increases appetite in some people. Both peptides can be used together to achieve better synergistic effects. Studies have shown that the highest concentrations of growth hormone in the blood is achieved just combinations of GHRP-6 and GHRP-second

GHRP-6 stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH. GHRP can be effectively used in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. GHRP-6 is highly effective in increasing blood levels of the hormone HGH and IGF-1, which is very convenient for those who want to improve their overall physical, but also mental health status of your body. GHRP-6 stimulates and strengthens the immune system, has a strong anabolic - for massive muscle gains and strength, helps burn body fat, has a very strong anti-aging effect, smooths wrinkles, improves the condition of hair and skin, gives a very good sleep and excellent regeneration, increases bone strength, has anti-inflammatory effects, brings a sense of the large influx of energy and vitality, and causing general overall rejuvenation of the body and all of its body tissues.

GHRP-6 can be used effectively in older people, a very effective anti-aging therapy. GHRP is often used in conjunction with CJC-1295 (GRF 1-29) for pulse amplification of growth hormone. GHRP-6 should be administered on an empty stomach, at least half an hour before meals. For bodybuilders and athletes GHRP-6 helps very effectively to gain muscle mass, increase strength, recovery and burn fat. GHRP-6 improves energy metabolism. After administration of GHRP-6 occurring rapidly increased appetite, often observed in connection with the leaching of ghrelin stimulation (approximately 20 minutes after injection). Ghrelin is a hormone naturally released in the walls of the stomach, which increases hunger. Due to these characteristics, GHRP-6 sometimes also used to treat cachexia (wasting), eating disorders and obesity.

GHRP-6 is very effective for increasing strength, muscle mass and fat loss (which makes it very popular in bodybuilding and fitness athletes), for total rejuvenation, strengthen joints, connective tissue and bone. Increased secretion of HGH in the liver leads to higher amount of IGF-1, which is considered a major metabolite anabolic growth hormone.

Main benefits and effects of GHRP-6:

GHRP-6 causes a significant increase in muscle mass and strength
GHRP-6 reduces the percentage body fat
GHRP-6 has a powerful anti-aging effect, provides rejuvenating effects
GHRP-6 improves the condition of hair and skin, stimulate collagen production, helping to smooth wrinkles
GHRP-6 delivers a deep sleep quality and perfect regeneration and recovery of the body during sleep
GHRP-6 boosts the immune system
GHRP-6 increases bone strength
GHRP-6 heals the liver
GHRP-6 has anti-inflammatory effect
Dosage:
Optimal dosing GHRP-6: Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the optimal dose of GHRP-6 is 1mcg / 1 kg body weight own 3x daily. For the purposes of anabolic (increase strength and muscle mass) can be used GHRP-6 times during the day (3-4 doses) for anti-aging therapy is most important that GHRP-6 enjoyed especially before bedtime.

GHRP-2 significantly stimulates the natural production of the natural endogenous growth hormone in the pituitary. Growth hormone (HGH) is metabolized in the liver to IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1). Studies have shown that IGF-1 causes a strong increase muscle mass and strength, while significantly reducing body fat. The regenerated nerve cells in the brain, stimulates the immune system, and is beneficial for the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, GHRP-2 has a very strong anti-aging effect (anti-aging effect), smooths wrinkles, improves the condition of hair and skin, delivering great quality sleep and regeneration, increases bone strength, has anti-inflammatory effects, brings a sense of vitality and ensure total rejuvenation of human body and all its organs and body tissues. GHRP-2 is also a great exercise for older people to effective anti-aging (rejuvenating) treatment. GHRP is often used in combination with the CJC-1295 for the amplification reactions. GHRP-2 take on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before a meal. For bodybuilders and athletes GHRP-2 very effectively builds muscle, increases strength, regeneration and fat burning. GHRP-2, unlike GHRP-6 does not have a tendency to cause an increased perceived hunger, but exceeding the recommended dose may in turn lead to an increase in cortisol and prolactin. GHRP-2 is very effective for increasing strength, muscle growth and fat loss (which is why it is very popular in bodybuilding and fitness sports) for total rejuvenation of the body, strengthen joints, connective tissue and bone stiffness. Increased levels of HGH in the liver causes the formation of increased quantities of strongly anabolic hormone, IGF-1, which is considered a major metabolite anabolic growth hormone. Main benefits and effects of GHRP-2: GHRP-2 causes an increase in muscle mass and strength GHRP-2 reduces the amount of body fat GHRP-2 has a powerful anti-aging effect - rejuvenating effects GHRP-2 improves the condition of hair and skin, stimulate collagen production GHRP-2 delivers quality sleep, perfect regeneration and recovery of body GHRP-2 enhances immunity GHRP-2 increases the rigidity of the bone GHRP-2 heals the liver GHRP-2 has anti-inflammatory effects Dosage: The ideal dosing GHRP-2: Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection at a dose of 1 mcg / 1 kg body weight, 3 times per day. If the main goal increase strength and muscle mass, it is best to use GHRP-2 times a day (3-4 doses) for anti-aging effect is substantial dose of GHRP-2 especially before bedtime. GHRP may be used alone or in combination with growth hormone directly. Both methods provide good results. Use or GHRP-2, GHRP-6, together with the injection of growth hormone mainly ensure that in spite of injections and their supplies of growth hormone into the body from outside the body and then continuing to produce endogenous growth hormone.

CJC-1295 DAC stimulates HGH and its interaction with GHRH in the body produces a ""family"" of growth hormones (GHR no other peptides will not produce such a wide spectrum of growth hormones such as CJC-1295). Very valuable and unique characteristics of CJC-1295 is a fact that can influence an increase in the amount of secretory cells and pituitary growth hormone, which can produce. The difference between CJC-1295 and CJC-1295 DAC is that CJC-1295 DAC version CJC-1295 with the addition of so-called. Drug Affinity Complex (DAC), which significantly prolong their effects and action. This means that the product will act in the body much longer than is usual in CJC-1295 (without DAC), namely up to 14 days! At the same time CJC-1295 DAC does not have such a steep ramp (sharp increase HGH levels) as CJC-1295, but it causes a smoother and more even increased levels of HGH. Clinical tests it was found that after one injection of CJC-1295 DAC content is increased growth hormone in the blood plasma from 3 to 10 times for 6 days, and increased IGF-1 concentrations 1.5-3 times for 9-12 days! Because of the long half-life and is stable even effects CJC-1295 DAC in fitness and bodybuilding becoming more and more popular.

It is a peptide having absolutely strongest influence on the release of growth hormone from any known GHR peptides. Hexarelin effect is very similar Ipamorelinu, as well as Ipamorelin can also apart from stimulating GH and block unwanted somatostatin (inhibijící hormone growth hormone). Compared Ipamorelinu disadvantage is however that when the recommended dose of 1 mcg application 1 per 1 kg body weight, may Hexarelin also increase the production of prolactin and cortisol, therefore not recommended for this reason to exceed this dose. Hexarelin does GHRP-6 compared with no effect on appetite. Currently Hexarelin very often used in bodybuilding and powerlifting. Hexarelin increase after administration of a growth factor MGF and IGF-1 to a maximum value, any other peptide, does GHR similar result. It sounds incredible, but because when you use Hexarelin-u can quickly gain massive muscle mass, even without physical exertion and exercise (samozřjemě assuming sufficient protein intake). Effects Hexarelin-u: Hexarelin effectively stimulates GH secretion from all GHRP (GHR peptides) Hexarelin significantly reduces body fat Hexarelin very effectively helps to build muscle mass and strength Hexarelin significantly improves relief, muscle hardness and density, drawing a Hexarelin strengthens bones Hexarelin improves the properties of the skin, reduces wrinkles Hexarelin effectively rejuvenating, has a strong anti-aging effect Hexarelin effectively strengthens the immune system Hexarelin provides a protective effect on the liver Hexarelin has significant anti-inflammatory effect Hexarelin improves recovery and regeneration Hexarelin brings a sense of energy and vitality Dosage: Ideal dose is 1 mcg-Hexarelin for 1 kg body weight 3-4 times daily. So if, for example. Your weight 80 kg, you'll need at least a day 240 micrograms Hexarelin-u (3x apply a dose of 80 mcg = 240 mcg per day Hexarelin total). For muscle growth Hexarelin is best applied first dose 30-40 minutes before a meal předtréninkovým, second dose immediately after exercise and the third dose at bedtime. The best combination is taken together with the peptide Hexarelin CJC-1295, which leads to their mutual synergistic effect. For example, if the effect of Hexarelin assign two imaginary points and the effect of CJC-1295 also two points, the combined use of both together will result in the sum of their individual effectiveness or 4 points (2 + 2 = 4), but 6 points.</p>","<pre>Product name: Hexarelin - 5mg Canada Peptides

It is a polypeptide hormone that causes very efficient secretion (secretion, formation), growth hormone (HGH) in the body. Its structure and amino acid sequence causes an even greater stimulation of growth hormone (GH), as is the case with other existing GHR peptide (e.g. GHRP-2 and GHRP-6). Its efficiency is higher and because Ipamorelin blocks and somatostatin (growth hormone hormone inhibijící). When used in conjunction e.g. with GHRH-6, GHRP-2 or CJC-1295, however, act synergistically Ipamorelin / has an even better effect and effect. It should be emphasized that Ipamorelin is not only effective, but also safe and selective stimulant GH because even in high standard dosage Ipamorelin will only stimulate growth hormone, and will not affect prolactin and cortisol in the blood. This property makes Ipamorelin for professional athletes so attractive, and it is currently regarded as the best option among all peptides that stimulate GH (GHR peptides). Ipamorelin hereinafter also increases the production of testosterone, which further increases its strong anabolic effect in the body. Ipamorelin very effectively influences the growth of strength and muscle mass, performance, significantly promotes fat loss, boosts immunity, protects the liver, provides anti-inflammatory effect and has a positive effect on sleep - make your sleep deeper, stronger, and longer. Furthermore Ipamorelin improves regeneration, skin and hair, smoothes wrinkles and has a strong anti-aging effect - anti-aging effect. Main effects and the benefits of using Ipamorelin-u: Ipamorelin strongly and effectively stimulates the secretion of growth hormone Ipamorelin significantly reduces fat deposits Ipamorelin effectively increases muscle growth and strength Ipamorelin relief significantly improves muscle hardness, density, vyrýsovanost Ipamorelin increases testosterone production Ipamorelin strengthens bones Ipamorelin delivers efficient recovery of joints and ligaments Ipamorelin improves the properties of the skin Ipamorelin has a significant impact on rejuvenation, anti-aging effect, visibly reduces wrinkles Ipamorelin improves regeneration, brings a sense of energy and vitality Ipamorelin effectively improves sleep quality Dosage: The optimal daily dose is 1 mcg Ipamorelin-u per 1 kg body weight, 3 times a day. For example: If you weigh 80 kg, you'll need 240 micrograms daily Ipamorelin-u (3x administered dose of 80 mcg = 240 mcg per day Ipamorelinu total). To increase muscle mass Ipamorelin best applied 40 minutes before a meal předtréninkovým, another dose immediately after exercise, and a third dose at bedtime. The best combination is considered to conjunction with the use Ipamorelinu peptide CJC-1295, which leads to their mutual synergistic effect. For example, if we assign effect Ipamorelinu imaginary two points and the effect of CJC-1295 also two points, the combined use of both together will result in the sum of their individual effectiveness of 4 points (2 + 2 = 4), but 6 points.

Tamoxifen Citrate was originally brought to the market place by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and introduced to the world as a suitable Morning After pill but in the end this would prove to be far from its positive purpose. Shortly after its inception is was discovered Nolvadex provided a formidable opponent against breast cancer but as is common soon performance purposes were found too. This is not an uncommon phenomenon, not by a long shot; many <strong>performance enhancing drugs</strong> start out as anything but performance enhancing drugs but so many in the end find this to be their primary purpose. However, unlike many anabolic steroids that have been found to fit this same bill Nolvadex does not actually enhance performance to a great degree but rather allows the individual to enhance more thoroughly as we will see; in-fact, Nolvadex has proven to be one of the more irreplaceable items in the arsenal of most performance enhancers.</p><h3>Nolvadex:</h3><p>Comprised of the active compound Tamoxifen Citrate but more well-known by its most common trade name Nolvadex and often referred to simply as Nolva Nolvadex belongs to a class of drugs known as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs.) In many ways this compound is very similar to another famous SERM Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid) with Nolva being more powerful on a milligram for milligram basis. <strong>Nolvadex</strong> exists as an antagonist of the estrogen receptors thereby preventing estrogen from binding and binding in its place. For this reason many often refer to this SERM as an anti-estrogen but this is a little off base. Nolvadex doesnt have the ability to reduce estrogen in the body nor does it have the ability to prevent it from forming and building up; for such an affect to occur one would need an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI.) AIs actively reduce estrogen in the body, most commonly Arimidex and Letrozole come to mind but they also aid in preventing the estrogen from existing in the first place and this is and can be very useful to most any anabolic steroid user. Nolvadex does not carry this nature with it; it merely blocks the estrogen from taking action to a degree; make no mistake, while not as powerful as an AI this trait can be very useful and it is hardly its only trait. Another thing to consider is the estrogen hormone itself, the very hormone it binds; sometimes reducing estrogen or limiting its existence really isnt a good thing; we actually need some estrogen in our system in order to be properly functioning human beings. Even so, when estrogen levels increase this can be a problem and this is when remedy must often take place. As estrogen binding is an important trait in-which this <strong>SERM possesses</strong> it is not the most important one, as Nolva has been proven to have a strong positive effect on natural testosterone production. When present in the body Nolvadex actively stimulates the release of Luteinizing Hormones (LH) a very important hormone, for it is its release <strong>that stimulates natural testosterone production</strong>. Without LH (among other things) there is no testosterone production in the body and as anabolicsteroids greatly suppress our natural testosterone production, again, this is where Nolvadex can prove to be very useful; in-fact, it is in this regard where we may find it to be the most useful of all.</p><h3>The Benefits of Nolvadex:</h3><p>As Nolvadex by nature performs two very specific actions it will have two very specific uses for the anabolic steroid user and each comes at a different time and serves its own unique purpose. No, the hormone does not change when we use it for one purpose rather than the other, regardless of use its very nature remains unchanged but it is the purpose of use that may vary and we will find the purpose of use to be while on cycle or during the Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan. For most anabolic steroid users Nolvadex will be part of a PCT supplemental plan and it is here that the SERM will serve its greatest purpose; so great we may aptly label Nolvadex as the single most important PCT medication of all time. As eluded to before anabolic androgenic steroids suppress natural testosterone production; regardless of the steroids used this will occur. It is true; some steroids will suppress more than others and while dosing and duration will play a large role suppression to some degree will exist. Once a cycle of anabolic steroids has come to an end the first order of business is to ensure natural testosterone production begins again and as fast as possible; even if your cycle included exogenous testosterone (which we highly recommend) your natural levels will still be suppressed and far from optimal. Restarting production is important largely for two reasons; what should be the most obvious is normalizing returning the body to its natural function in order to maintain proper health. Further, the faster we can restart natural production; thereby ensuring adequate testosterone is in our body the more gains we will hold onto that we earned through the cycle. It is very important to note while Nolvadex therapy is very useful for this purpose a simple PCT plan that includes the SERM will not by itself bring natural levels back to normal. Yes, it will greatly speed up the process but a standard 3-4 week PCT plan is not going to have you where you were before your cycle began. As PCT purposes are perhaps its greatest trait it is another purpose that first made the SERM quite popular among performance enhancers and this was as an on cycle side-effect preventer and most notably as a Gynecomastia fighting agent. They do not all possess this trait but many anabolic steroids convert to estrogen via the aromatase process and as estrogen increases so can its negative effects; there is truly a fine line when it comes to the total amount of estrogen you want and can tolerate. As estrogen levels increase Gynecomastia can become very problematic but if the estrogen cannot bind to the receptors as Nolvadex will prevent, the odds of incurring Gyno as it is commonly known greatly reduce. While a very powerful Gyno preventer, for some Nolva will not be enough and many will find they need to actively reduce estrogen and inhibit it from forming in the first place; for this individual only an AI will do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Nolvadex:</h3><p>Without question Nolvadex is one of the milder and most highly well-tolerated items any performance enhancer will ever use with its greatest adverse side-effect being its absence. Nevertheless, as discussed some estrogen is needed in the body and thankfully Nolvadex wont bring your levels down for if nothing else estrogen is essential to a functioning immune system among many other things. However, some have speculated that by its binding ability it may prohibit estrogen from doing its job to too much of a degree; however, this appears to be mere speculation by those of an anti-performance enhancing nature as there is no proof that this problem could ever exist. There have also been issues of metabolic function that have arose in the past but again, the evidence to support such claims is found very lacking and it is very rarely an issue brought up in the first place. There is also a possible side-effect regarding on cycle use that is linked to growth and many <strong>anabolic steroid</strong>users report their growth is somewhat diminished when Nolva is present. It is true, as estrogen is important to the growth or the gaining process this could be a problem when certain items are used but as Nolva doesnt actually reduce estrogen and presents very little action in this regard that would lend to such a problem as we are confirmed in our thinking that is largely in ones head; the evidence simply isnt there.</p><h3>Nolvadex and Clomid:</h3><p>In the world of performance enhancing there are very few items as similar as Nolvadex and Clomid and both can serve a PCT plan equally as well but in many circles this is often argued but it is an argument often lacking in weight. It is true, on a per milligram basis Nolvadex is far more powerful than Clomid and automatically most will assume Nolvadex is the better SERM. However, all things considered equal, if an individual used Clomid for his PCT and another used Nolvadex adjusting the doses to match up in milligram potency, again, all things equal the results would be fairly close to the same. Some studies have shown however that recovery might be a little faster with the Nolvadex SERM but it is not to a massively large degree and in the end either is fine. However, most will not use enough Clomid to match the power of Nolva for to match 40mg of Nolvadex you will need approximately 150mg of Clomiphene Citrate but the good news is both are cheap, almost never faked and in the end either will do.</p><h3>Nolvadex Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Depending on the period of use will determine how we cycle and dose our <strong>Nolvadex</strong> to a very large degree. For the performance enhancer while on cycle generally <strong>10mg per day</strong> the entire duration is well-suited for the prevention of Gynecomastia but some may need a little more. However, if you need more than <strong>10mg per day</strong> theres a good chance youre going to need something stronger than Nolva to begin with and in this case an AI is going to be in your future. While total cycle use may sound concerning to some recall from our side-effects discussion; adverse effects are not of a great concern here and extended use is very well-tolerated. For PCT use, Nolvas absolute best period of use, the total dosing will be much higher than on cycle use and the duration of use rather short lived. In most cases the dosing will start at 40mg per day for almost any individual regardless of the extent of his cycle and in most cases two total weeks of this dosing is advised. After the first two weeks have passed a good two weeks at <strong>20mg per day</strong> will generally be warranted and for many this will be the end of their PCT. For many this will be all the therapy they need and if you feel you need a little more time another week or two of low dose Nolva may not be too bad of an idea; it is one of those things you may have to play around with a little bit over the course of a few cycles to find what works best for you. Further, for ultimate PCT help you will find Nolvadex works very well with hCG; in-fact, in almost any PCT plan we highly recommend hCG with Nolva use, beginning and completing hCG use right before Nolvadex therapy begins. Not all cycles will require a PCT such as this; mild cycles and newbie cycles may be fine without it but even in a mild cycle such precaution will not hurt and will greatly aid you in the end.</p>","<pre>Tamoxifen Citrate 100 tabs / 10 mg/tab.</pre>",publish,,0,"2021-07-05 13:48:17",1,open,1000,,,no,no,,75,,,,,,,,outofstock,no,no,,no,taxable,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://steroids4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1584.jpg ! alt :  ! title : 1584 ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://steroids4u.eu/product/tamoxifen-ebewe-10-nolvadex/,0,,,,,,,,,,,simple,outofstock,"ANTIESTROGENS and PCT|Mix other products|ORIGINAL PHARMACY PRODUCTS",,

Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. Boldabolic (Boldenone Undecylenate) is considered a mildly estrogenic steroid with estrogenic side effects usually not pronounced unless this drug is taken in doses above 200 – 400 mg per week. An anti-estrogen may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis.<h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3>Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.<h3>Hepatotoxic Side Effects</h3>Boldenone (Boldenone Undecylenate) does not have hepatotoxic effects and therefore, liver toxicity is unlikely.<h3>Cardiovascular Side Effects</h3>Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance in a direction that favors greater risk of arteriosclerosis. The relative impact of an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Boldenone (Boldenone Undecylenate) is likely to have a less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic oral anabolic steroids. To help reduce cardiovascular strain, it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active steroid administration. Supplementing with fish oils and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula is also recommended.<h3>Testosterone Suppression</h3>All anabolic/androgenic steroids are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession. Note that prolonged hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.<h3>Administration for Men</h3>It is most commonly used at a dosage of 200 – 400 mg per week. The dosage schedule can be further divided to reduce the volume of each injection if necessary, perhaps administering the drug two to three times per week. One should also take caution to rotate injection sites regularly, so as to avoid irritation or infection. The positive effects of this drug become most apparent when it is used for longer cycles, usually lasting 8 weeks or more in duration. Boldenone (Boldenone Undecylenate) is a very versatile drug, and can be combined with a number of other agents depending on the desired result.<h3>Administration for Women</h3>When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, women take much lower doses of Boldabolic (Boldenone Undecylenate) than men, typically 50 – 75 mg per week. Women should take caution with the slow-acting characteristics of this preparation, which make blood levels difficult to control and slow to decline should virilization symptoms become present.</div>","<pre><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Boldenone undecylenate 250mg, 250 mg/ml (10 ml)

Drostanolone is a derivative of dihydrotestosterone, most specifically 2alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone. As a result, the structure of this steroid is that of a moderate anabolic/potent androgen which does not aromatize to estrogen. Water retention and gynecomastia are therefore not a concern with this compound; as of course here estrogen is usually the culprit. Masteron may in fact exhibit antiestrogenic activity in the body, competing with other substrates for binding to aromatase. This would reduce the conversion rate of other steroids, Masteron acting in the same manner as the oral steroid Proviron. Bodybuilders have a strong appreciation for non-aromatizing androgens, and find Masteron very useful as a cutting agent. It is likewise generally used a number of weeks prior to a competition, in an effort to bring out an improved look of density and hardness to the muscles. For this purpose Masteron should work exceptionally well so long as the body fat percentage is low enough. Provided everything fits as if should, the user can achieve that ""ripped"" look so popular to professional bodybuilding. The androgenic effect can also be crucial during this period, a time when caloric intake is drastically lowered. The user is provided added ""kick"" or ""drive"" to push through the grueling training sessions leading up to the show. Drostanoione was once also popular with athletes subject to drug testing, as for a period of time this compound was not screened for during competition. The urinary metabolites of drostanoione were recognized by the early 90's however, and this drug now adjoins a long list of anabolic/androgenic steroids identifiable during urinalysis testing. Although some bodybuilders claim they can safely use Masteron if discontinued three to four weeks before a test, there are always uncertainties with the use of esterified injectable steroids. This perhaps makes the oral DHT Proviron (1-ethyldihydrotestosterone) a slightly better choice, as orals offer much better control. Recreational users might also be interested in Masteron. Although dihydrotestosterone is not highly active in muscle tissue, the 2 alkylation present on drostanoione considerably intensifies its anabolic effect. It can therefore be used somewhat effectively as bulking agent, providing a consistent gain of high quality muscle mass. It can also be successfully combined with other steroids for an enhanced effect. Mixing drostanoione with an injectable anabolic such as Deca-Durabolin (nandroione decanoate) or Equipoise (boldenone undecylenate) can prove quite useful for example, the two providing notably enhanced muscle gain without excessive water retention. For greater mass gains, one can alternately addition a stronger androgen such as Dianabol or an injectable testosterone. The result here can be an extreme muscle gain, with a lower level of water retention &amp; other estrogenic side effects than if these steroids were used alone (usually in higher doses). Masteron could of course be used during cutting phases of training as well. A cycle of this drug combined with Winstrol, Primobolan or Cxandrolone should provide great muscle retention and fat loss, during a period which can be very catabolic without steroids. It is an added benefit that none of these steroids aromatize, and therefore there is no additional worry of unwanted water/fat retention. The propionate ester used with this compound will extend its activity for only a few days. With such a short duration of effect, injections need to be repeated at least every 3 or 4 days in order to maintain a consistent level of hormone in the blood. Factoring this in with its low strength (50 mg/ml), men will generally inject a full 2 ml ampule of Masteron (100 mg) every two or three days. The weekly dosage therefore lands in the range of 200-350 mg, a level more than sufficient to receive good results. We also should mention that while some women do profess to using this item before a show, it is much too androgenic in nature to recommend. Virilization symptoms can result quickly with its use, making Masteron a very risky item to experiment with. If attempted, the dosage should be limited to no more than 25 to 50 mg each week. The female athlete would be further served by increasing the number of days between injections to prevent buildup of steroid in the body. In this case, Masteron can perhaps be administered once every 7 days. Since estrogen offers us no trouble, side effects are generally mild with this steroid. As discussed earlier, gynecomastia and water retention go unseen. So are problems controlling blood pressure, again usually associated with estrogen. Masteron is also not liver toxic, so there is little concern stress will be placed on this organ, even during longer cycles. The only prominent side effects stem from the basic androgenic properties of dihydrotestosterone. This includes oily skin, acne, body/facial hair growth, aggression and accelerated hair loss. Since this compound is already a synthetic DHT, Proscar would have no impact on the level of androgenic effects. Men with a receding hairline (or those with a known familial predisposition for baldness) may therefore wish to stay away from Masteron completely, as the potent androgenic effect of this steroid can easily exacerbate such a condition.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/ml (vial 10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Drostanolone Propionate 100 mg

Sustamix is a strong anabolic drug with pronounced androgenic activity. It is most commonly used in bulking cycles, providing exceptional gains in strength and muscle mass.<h3>Estrogenic Side Effects</h3>Testosterone Mix LEGITLIFT (Testosterone Mix) is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. Testosterone Mix LEGITLIFT (Testosterone Mix) is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor.<h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3>Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Men with a genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in other, less androgenic steroids. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.<h3>Hepatotoxic Side Effects</h3>Sustamix (Testosterone mix) does not have hepatotoxic effects and therefore, liver toxicity is unlikely.<h3>Cardiovascular Side Effects</h3>Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance in a direction that favors greater risk of arteriosclerosis. The relative impact of an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Testosterone Mix LEGITLIFT (Testosterone mix) tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol. The aromatization of testosterone to estradiol also helps to mitigate the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, aromatase inhibitors are preferred for those concerned with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver. To help reduce cardiovascular strain, it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active steroid administration. Supplementing with fish oils and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula is also recommended.<h3>Testosterone Suppression</h3>All anabolic/androgenic steroids are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession. Note that prolonged hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.<h3>Administration for Men</h3>To treat androgen insufficiency, the recommended dosage of 250 mg is given every 3 weeks. The usual dosage among male athletes is in the range of 250 – 750 mg per injection, taken in cycles 6 to 12 weeks in length. This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength. Sustamix (Testosterone mix) is usually incorporated into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than definition. Sustamix (Testosterone mix) is a very effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. However, it is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.<h3>Administration for Women</h3>Testosterone Mix LEGITLIFT (Testosterone mix) is rarely used with women in clinical medicine. Testosterone Mix LEGITLIFT (Testosterone mix) is not recommended for women for performance enhancing purposes due to its strong androgenic nature and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.</div>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Sustanon 250mg, 250 mg/ml (10 ml)

It is also one of the most popular performance enhancing steroids of all time the world over and if you’ve ever considered anabolic androgenic steroids there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Testosterone-Cypionate. As are all testosterone forms Testosterone-Cypionate is highly anabolic and androgenic with an anabolic and androgenic rating of 100 in each; in-fact, it is the anabolic and androgenic rating of testosterone by-which all anabolic androgenic steroids are measured. As Testosterone-Cypionate is just that, 100% pure testosterone, you will find it to be a perfect anabolic steroid for almost any purpose and one of the most efficiently well-tolerated anabolic hormones of all. As we look at this compound and try to gain an understanding you will find there are two key points of interest in gaining the knowledge you need; understanding the hormone testosterone itself and how the Cypionate ester that is attached affects it. By this understanding you will discover that all testosterone is virtually the same, as the hormone itself does not change due to the ester that is attached; the ester is not a hormone but rather a mechanism attached to the hormone that affects its activity and total action.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce and it is a hormone all human beings naturally produce, both men and women. While men require nearly ten times the amount of women, in both sexes the hormone plays host to numerous responsibilities in the body that range from muscle tissue growth and preservation, metabolic and sexual function to a host of others all comprising of a well-functioning endocrine system. Many individuals the world over suffer from <strong>low levels of the testosterone hormone</strong>, the most common cause being age. As men age their natural testosterone levels decline but this effect can be seen in women as well, especially women who are post-menopause and <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate </strong>is often the means by-which it is remedied. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone he or she may experience a host of problems ranging from muscle and strength loss, a loss of libido and sexual function, increased body-fat, depression, a weakened immune system to a host of other ailments and conditions. In most cases such conditions are easily treated by simply supplementing with a testosterone based hormone and by simply returning levels to a stable yet normal level will in most cases see such conditions resolved. In a strong sense we can look at TRT therapy in a similar light when examining performance enhancement, the difference simply being taking our testosterone levels beyond the normal range, thereby enhancing the effects of the hormone even more so. For the majority of performance enhancers this will revolve around muscle growth and preservation, increasing strength and overall athletic performance as well as <strong>improving metabolic activity within the body</strong>. <em>Testosterone-Cypionate</em> use is one of the best methods of achieving such goals as its direct mode of action simply promotes their enhancement. As is caused by the presence of testosterone the hormone dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis and further enhances red blood cells by increasing the amount and structural capacity. Testosterone also has the ability to block and reduce glucocorticoid hormones in the body, also known as muscle wasting hormones; the most famous of all being cortisol. These hormones, often referred to as “<strong>stress hormones</strong>” can have disastrous effects as they destroy muscle tissue and promote fat gain, all leading to slower metabolic activity and making fat-loss more difficult than it needs to be. Further and of particular interest, when the testosterone hormone is present in levels beyond therapeutic measure our natural IGF-1 levels increase and as IGF-1 is a powerful anabolic hormone itself, a hormone that plays a key role within every cell of the body, our total activity in both an anabolic and metabolic nature increases yet again. Now that you have an understanding of testosterone the obvious point of interest is how does the Cypionate ester play a role and function. The ester of the steroid is largely what determines the steroids half-life and the larger the ester the longer the half-life will be. The ester attached also affects a particular steroids initial activity but and while not of particular great importance it also affects the compounds total mass. The larger the ester the more mass it takes up in the compound; for example,<strong>100mg of testosterone with no ester attached is simply 100mg of testosterone whereas 100mg of testosterone with an ester attached will be a little less than 100mg of actual hormone</strong>; how much less will be determined by the size of the ester. In the case of Testosterone-Cypionate we have a compound that carries with it a moderately long half-life as Cypionate is a fairly large ester; the half-life of Testosterone-Cypionate is approximately 12 days long. As a long ester based anabolic steroid the effects of the compound will not be felt very fast but the total activity will stretch past much further than smaller ester based forms such as Testosterone-Propionate. To understand how the half-life works is fairly simple; <strong>when we inject 200mg of testosterone Cypionate, a very common dose per injection for any purpose, 12 days past this injection 100mg of active testosterone will be left in the body; as another 12 days passes 50mg of active testosterone will be left in the body and so on until no testosterone is left</strong>; this of course does not take into account further injections that may occur but is based on one injection so that understanding may be gained.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>It should be at this stage fairly easy to see the benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate and it doesn’t take a genius to see they are almost everything anyone could ever want out of anabolic steroid use. A common benefit often overlooked is the testosterone hormone’s <strong>ability to increase metabolic activity and in-truth this may be one of the greatest benefits of all and for all users of all purposes</strong>. For the HRT patient it allows him to garner a healthier physique pure and simple. For the performance enhancer it not only allows him to garner a more pleasing physique but one that is more efficient in nature; the higher our metabolic activity the more efficient our body becomes in most all aspects. Of course often the principle reason of supplemental testosterone use is to increase mass, strength and athletic performance and Testosterone-Cypionate will aid in every aspect and do so remarkably well; however, there are important things to understand. If you’re basing your understanding of Testosterone-Cypionate on popular culture references regarding anabolic steroids then all you need to do is grab a bottle, fill a syringe, inject and watch the show start; sorry, it doesn’t quite work this way. If you are after a true performance enhancing edge you still have to feed the body properly with adequate amounts of food and physical stimulation; through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate we simply enhance these aspects and increase the efficiency. For the TRT patient this might be a relief, for many TRT patients are petrified of testosterone therapy because they assume they’ll turn into the Incredible Hulk; if you do not feed and stimulate properly and in adequate amounts you have nothing to fear; further, HRT doses are typically too low to really do anything in this regard even if you do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>When examining the side-effects of Testosterone-Cypionate or any testosterone there is some good news right from the start; as testosterone is not a foreign substance it is not a hormone our bodies are unaccustomed to; you’ve been producing it at some level your entire life. Even so, when we enter into our body anything of an exogenous nature there is a potential for negative side-effects and the level of potential can vary with each and every item. The same can be said of all anabolic androgenic steroids, the level of potential varies with each and every one; nevertheless, while there is potential the probability is much lower than with many common over the counter medications, especially when we look at testosterone. Testosterone in many ways shouldn’t really be viewed as a drug, it doesn’t share any traits with what we use to determine if something is a drug and it’s not, it’s a hormone and there is a big, big difference. For healthy adult men most all will find that Testosterone-Cypionate is very well-tolerated when used responsibly; in-fact, numerous studies including those done by the New England Journal of Medicine have shown that even in supraphysiological doses the testosterone hormone can be used safely and without side-effects. While responsible use will always be best some individuals may find side-effects to occur and such side-effects caused by Testosterone-Cypionate will be of an estrogenic nature. Testosterone converts to estrogen once present in the body due to the aromatase process and by the buildup of estrogen problems such as <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues can occur</strong>. While these can be very problematic many individuals will never have to take note of them while just as many will but fortunately we can easily do something about it. While total dose will play a large role so will individual sensitivity but in either case anti-estrogen medications can prove to be invaluable here; most notably and with the greatest authority aromatase inhibitors (AI’s.) An AI actively inhibits the aromatase process as well as reduces the amount of estrogen in your body; understand what doesn’t exist cannot convert and what cannot convert cannot lead to a negative effect. There is another side-effect we must mention and it is one that will affect every man; testicular atrophy. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids, including testosterone our natural testosterone production is suppressed and as testosterone is produced in the testicles, when this production is in decline the testicles shrink. However, through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate this is of no physical concern as our body is being supplied with all the testosterone it needs. Further, testicular atrophy does not imply shriveled up raisins, it simply means the total mass will be a little less and anyone who has ever supplemented with Testosterone-Cypionate before can tell you it’s really not that big of a deal. Most importantly, when use is discontinued the testicles will return to their normal size; as no exogenous hormones of an anabolic steroidal nature are entering the body natural testosterone production will begin again. However, this will generally prove to be useless information to the TRT patient as he will more than likely be on continuous <strong>testosterone therapy</strong> for the remainder of his life.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate vs. Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>They are the two most commonly used Testosterones in both performance enhancement and TRT and two of the most commonly used anabolic steroids of all kinds the world over; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate. For years, decades even there has been a constant back and forth argument on which one is better and you will find individuals on both sides of the fence who swear up and down they are right; so the question is, which one is it? The answer, neither; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate are almost identical in every single way, so closely related that any difference is of such an insignificant nature that the users could not possibly benefit more or less from one or the other. Look at it like this; you have two sandwiches made by the same person with the same ingredients, one was made right now and the other 32 seconds before; one comes with a pickle on the side; which sandwich is better? To give you a more specific understanding both are pure testosterone, both are attached to large esters and while <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate most commonly comes dosed at 200mg/ml</strong> and<strong>Testosterone-Enanthate most commonly comes dosed at 250mg/ml</strong> the individual can easily adjust the amounts to receive identical dosing with each. The only difference here lies within the half-life of each; recall, Testosterone-Cypionate carries with it a half-life of approximately 12 days while Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it a half-life of approximately 36 hours less; when we’re extending past a week in total half-life with only 36 hours difference this is meaningless. The truth is simple; the same dosing of each testosterone compound will produce identical results.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Regardless of your purpose be it performance enhancement, TRT or a full blown HRT program you will be very hard pressed to find a better testosterone than Testosterone-Cypionate. In the world of TRT most will find 200mg every 7-10 days to be fairly common place and generally speaking about as high as you’ll ever go but of course in performance enhancing doses will necessarily be much higher. For the performance enhancer minimal dosing will generally be in the <strong>400mg-500mg per week</strong> range and most commonly split into two even doses twice per week; for example, for <strong>400mg total per week</strong> you might administer the hormone at 200mg on Monday and 200mg on Thursday continuing such a schedule until your total duration is complete. For many <strong>500mg per week</strong> will be as high as they ever need to go but in more hardcore circles it is not uncommon for doses to reach levels of <strong>1,000mg per week</strong> and at extreme elite levels, especially in competitive bodybuilding they can go much higher. Keep in mind, while the benefits of use will increase as the dose does so will the potential and probability of adverse effects. There is a strong risk to reward ratio at play and in the end you are the only one who can determine how far you want to go with that. Yes, absolutely anabolic steroids and especially those of a pure testosterone nature such as Testosterone-Cypionate can be used safely and effectively but responsible use will always prove to be the ultimate key. Part of responsible use will always include what is known as a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan in order to normalize the body after use has been discontinued. Recall, the use of such hormones as Testosterone-Cypionate will suppress natural testosterone production but natural production will begin again once use is discontinued; however, such production will not begin instantly and there are things we can do to speed up the process. The sooner we get our natural production back up and running the more progress we made through our anabolic steroid use will be kept but most importantly our overall health will be protected; recall yet again, testosterone is essential to our health. This is where a good PCT plan comes in and it is by this plan we can stimulate natural production to begin; common supplemental items often include SERM’s such as Nolvadex andClomid as well as the hormone hCG.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (vial 10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Testosterone Cypionate 250 mg

Testosterone is the principle anabolic hormone in men, highly favored by athletes for its ability to promote strong increases in muscle mass and strength.<h3>Estrogenic Side Effects</h3>Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor.<h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3>Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.<h3>Hepatotoxic Side Effects</h3>Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) does not have hepatotoxic effects and therefore, liver toxicity is unlikely.<h3>Cardiovascular Side Effects</h3>Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance in a direction that favors greater risk of arteriosclerosis. The relative impact of an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol. The aromatization of testosterone to estradiol also helps to mitigate the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, aromatase inhibitors are preferred for those concerned with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver. To help reduce cardiovascular strain, it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active steroid administration. Supplementing with fish oils and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula is also recommended.<h3>Testosterone Suppression</h3>All anabolic/androgenic steroids are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession. Note that prolonged hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.<h3>Administration for Men</h3>To treat androgen insufficiency, the recommended dosage is 50 – 400 mg of Testen (Testosterone enanthate) every 2 to 4 weeks. Although active in the body for a longer time, Testen (testosterone enanthate) is usually injected on a weekly basis for muscle-building purposes. The usual dosage for physique- or performance- enhancing purposes is in the range of 200 – 600 mg per week, taken in cycles 6 to 12 weeks in length. This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength. Testen (testosterone enanthate) is usually incorporated into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than definition. Testen (testosterone enanthate) is a very effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. However, it is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.<h3>Administration for Women</h3>Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) is rarely used with women in clinical medicine. Testen (Testosterone Enanthate) is not recommended for women for performance enhancing purposes due to its strong androgenic nature and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.</div>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">250 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Testosterone Enanthate 250mg, 250 mg/ml (10 ml)

Trenbolone-Enanthate is not only one of the most popular steroids of all time but one of the most popular because it is one of the most powerful and one of the most effective. Truly one of the most versatile anabolic steroids on the market, users will find it is perfect for almost any cycle, from cutting and bulking or any other purpose you might find. As is common with very powerful steroids it can also be one of the harsher and for this reason many will not be able to use it; unfortunately while very powerful it is not always well-tolerated. However, make no mistake, the strong majority will be fine but many will still find its power to be a little too much.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Enanthate:</h3><p>In order to understand Trenbolone-Enanthate we must first understand the Trenbolone hormone itself then with an understanding of how the Enanthate ester affects it we can fully understand the benefits it can provide. Trenbolone-Enanthate, like all Trenbolone forms is a 19-nor class anabolic androgenic steroid that is both highly anabolic and androgenic. The Trenbolone hormone is so powerful it is 500 times more anabolic than testosterone, as well as 500 times more androgenic; as testosterone alone is so powerful this should give you a pretty good idea of how amazing this steroidreally is. By its very nature the Trenbolone hormone binds exceptionally well to the androgen receptors of the body and while this can provide many benefits perhaps most interestingly it gives Tren as it is commonly known the ability to directly promote lipolysis; in-fact, while all anabolic steroids promote metabolic activity Trenbolone is one of the few that does so in such a direct manner. Trenbolone also plays an important role regarding the naturally produced protein hormone IGF-1; many anabolic androgenic steroids promote the release of this powerful hormone but few do so anywhere close to the level of Tren. Trenbolone’s presence in the body will dramatically increase IGF-1 levels and as this hormone affects nearly every cell in the body in a highly anabolic fashion the body’s positive functioning ability increases tenfold. This is among other reasons why the Trenbolone hormone so greatly and rapidly promotes the healing and regeneration process and this is not only important to the growing athlete but perhaps even more so to the dieting one as Trenbolone may indeed be the best muscle preserver available. Among other important traits, as is common with all testosterone based hormones Tren will greatly increase nitrogen retention and protein synthesis, as well as red blood cell production; however, it simply does so to a far greater degree, so much so that many other steroids stacked together could not perform as powerfully as Tren. Further, as you recall, the hormone also directly promotes fat-loss but it further dramatically prohibits the presence of muscle wasting hormones such as cortisol. All of these factors when coupled together simply give the individual a more powerful and efficient physique as well as one that is far more pleasing to the eye. All of the traits discussed thus far are very important and alone they make <em>Trenbolone-Enanthate</em> a powerful anabolic steroid worth consideration but of all the traits there is one that truly stands above all and indeed allows this hormone to stand tall above the rest. Trenbolone as by its original design greatly promotes what is known as “Feed Efficiency” or what may be more accurate for our purposes “Nutrient Efficiency.” The Trenbolone hormone first hit the market as a means to beef up cattle and the main attribute was simply enhancing the nutritional value of the food cattle would eat. As you understand there is nothing more important than the food we eat; all the anabolic steroids in the world are of little value if our nutritional intake is not up to par. With the introduction of the Trenbolone hormone into the equation the food we eat simply becomes more valuable; the hormone literally enhances the food you’re already eating allowing it to work more efficiently within the body. When we eat certain foods only a certain amount of each nutrient will be able to be used; for example, certain protein sources absorb better than others, such as eggs; you can absorb and use a larger portion of the protein derived from an egg than you can red meat. In the case of eggs and red meat, while both can be very valuable to the athlete, with Trenbolone in play all the nutrients they provide simply become more valuable as their efficiency increases. As you now have a good understanding of the hormone the next step is to understand the ester. Trenbolone is a hormone that can be attached to a variety of esters but generally you will find it attached to the Acetate, Enanthate or Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate. While the Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate was the original form available to most athletes, most commonly known as Parabolan true Parabolan is no longer manufactured; some underground labs still make a Parabolan version, generally referred to as Tren-Hex but the original has long since been discontinued. This leaves us the very first Trenbolone hormone ever used in Trenbolone-Acetate and it is without question the most popular and the very effective Trenbolone-Enanthate compound and that is what we are concerned with here. As you understand anabolic androgenic steroids the particular ester attached is not a hormone, it is merely an ester and the ester attached does not change the hormones mode of action or traits it provides once in the body. In the case of Tren, as is with testosterone, all Trenbolone varieties are the same regarding the hormone itself, the ester attach will however largely determine the hormones half-life, meaning, how long it will remain active in the body, affect its initial activity time and play a role in the total mass of the compound. Trenbolone-Enanthate is a large ester based anabolic steroid and as such it will not become noticeable as quickly as smaller ester forms; however, its total activity will stretch far past smaller ester forms. As a long ester based Tren, <strong>Trenbolone-Enanthate</strong> does not need to be injected very frequently, in-fact most will find 2 injections per week or simply a schedule of one every 4 days to be sufficient. You will also find this compound on a per milligram basis to be a little weaker than Trenbolone-Acetate, meaning to receive the same dosing with Tren-E as it is most commonly known the individual would need a little more on a weekly basis to receive the same amount as if the Acetate version were being used. The reason for this is simple; when we take 100mg of both forms a larger amount of the Tren-E form is ester, as larger esters take up more mass in a compound than smaller ones.</p><h3>The Benefits of Trenbolone-Enanthate:</h3><p>As can be determined by simply understanding the hormone we can easily see it can and will provide nearly every trait any individual could ever desire through anabolic steroid use. Is it the perfect steroid; side-effects aside we can say with assurance if it’s not it’s about as close as you can get. Individuals who supplement with Trenbolone-Enanthate will find they can do so and with equal effectiveness in both bulking a cutting cycles; the Trenbolone hormone is truly one of the most all around all-purpose steroids available. Individuals who supplement with Trenbolone-Enanthate during their off-season period will find that it greatly promotes lean tissue gain as well as massive increases in strength and as the steroid will not aromatize any weight gain will be 100% pure lean tissue. For the dieting athlete this may indeed be the most powerfully effective point of use as its very traits not only promote fat-loss directly but also lend to the preservation of tissue and an enhancement of its appearance far more than any steroid available. Trenbolone will greatly preserve muscle better than any <strong>anabolic steroid</strong>, thereby keeping your overall metabolic rate higher; the more lean tissue you carry the more powerful your anabolic activity will be. In the same light, the hormone will also greatly promote preserving strength, meaning, athletes who diet while supplementing with the Trenbolone hormone will find their strength is more easily maintained than without. It’s no secret, when you diet some strength loss will occur but we can minimize this to a great degree first and foremost by our diets themselves and by the addition of the Trenbolone hormone. Trenbolone-Enanthate also carries with it traits that will be very important to the competitive bodybuilder or for the individual who is simply looking for a similar type physique; hardness and more pronounced vascularity. It must be noted, while these are fantastic traits they are not simply outright; the individual must be lean for the pronounced affects to be visible, the <strong>Trenbolone hormone</strong> will not make a fat physique hard all on its own. Nevertheless, the hardening affect this steroid can provide is truly amazing and its raw power in this regard is beyond any other steroid or any stack you can come up with.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Trenbolone-Enanthate:</h3><p>In the discussion of anabolic androgenic steroids there are many similarities regarding side-effects from one form to the next and you will find the severity of probability greatly varies within each one. As it pertains to Trenbolone-Enanthate we will find this to be one of the harsher compounds on the market in-terms of side-effects; so much so many who read this will never be able to use it. It is true, most will be fine; most who supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids in the first place are fine but there are more individuals who suffer from negative side-effects from Trenbolone than perhaps any other anabolic androgenic steroid. A common mistake many make regarding the Trenbolone hormone is making an inaccurate assumption. The assumption is simple; Trenbolone-Enanthate does not aromatize, therefore water retention is of no concern and this is true, as the hormone does not aromatize you will not hold any water due to its presence. However, as it will not aromatize most assume Gynecomastia is of no concern and this is incorrect. Yes, you can fall prey to Gynecomastia due to Trenbolone use simply because it is a progestin. As <strong>it will increase progestin Gynecomastia can occur in the same light as it can due to aromatization and the buildup of estrogen</strong>; thankfully a good aromatase inhibitor will as always block this horrible occurrence. Other side-effects such as acne and hair-loss can occur as well but most will find acne to be of very little concern and any <strong>hair-loss</strong> will be genetically predetermined; meaning, you were going to go bald any way, the presence of Trenbolone simply brought some <strong>hair-loss</strong> about sooner than it might have been. While the above side-effects are and can be important, especially regarding Gynecomastia, they are by no means the factors that make this such a harsh compound. The most common side-effects of<strong>Trenbolone-Enanthate use are insomnia, night sweats, rapid heart rate, anxiety and a loss of libido and to a very large degree</strong>; in-fact, almost all who supplement will more than likely fall prey to at least one of these side-effects. As it pertains to libido it should be noted, this will generally only occur if the dose gets too high or if there is not enough testosterone in your system to counter the effect; those who supplement with adequate exogenous testosterone will not have a problem. As for the rest of the side-effects there is simply no way to predict if they will occur or how great their severity will be; it will truly vary greatly from one individual to the next. There is however an important point of interest regarding these side-effects, so important we will delve into it in its own section below.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Enanthate vs. Trenbolone-Acetate:</h3><p>While Trenbolone-Enanthate is both very powerful and effective Trenbolone-Acetate remains the most popular form and for a couple of reasons but there is one reason that is of particular importance. As the side-effects of Trenbolone use can be harsh, if they become more than you can handle hopefully for your sake Trenbolone-Acetate will be the Tren in your system. If the individual is supplementing with Tren and using the long ester Enanthate form, if side-effects become a problem and he discontinues use he will still have to deal with the negative reaction for several weeks. Conversely, if he is supplementing with the Acetate version, as a very small ester base he can discontinue use and generally be side-effect free in a matter of a few short days. For this reason it is very important to supplement with Trenbolone-Acetate the first time you ever supplement with Tren in-order to determine how your body will react. Another point of interest is in the power of the Trenbolone hormone and while there is no hard evidence of this the individual reports are so strong it bears worth mentioning. As you understand on a milligram for milligram scale Trenbolone-Acetate is the most powerful of all as less of the compounds mass is comprised of ester. The same can be said of large and small testosterone forms and while small ester forms such as Testosterone-Propionate carry more testosterone per milligram than larger testosterone forms such as Testosterone-Cypionate we can easily adjust the doses accordingly to ensure we receive the same amount of testosterone with any form. The same thinking can be applied to Trenbolone as well; however, report after report seems to promote individuals experience slightly better results from the Acetate form over the Enanthate version, even when doses are matched to make up for the difference in ester. However, one must understand, if he is to supplement with Trenbolone-Acetate he will necessarily inject the hormone far more frequently and for some this can be rather inconvenient.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Enanthate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Regardless of purpose, be it bulking or cutting most will find Trenbolone-Enanthate to be very effective in the <strong>300mg-500mg per week</strong> range with 400mg per week generally being a very solid dose. Yes, you can use more but most will find doses that get much past 500mg per week to be a little less side-effect friendly, especially if they enter the 600mg per week range and almost assuredly if they surpass 700mg per week. Regardless of dosing most will find 8 weeks to be decently<strong>effective with 12 weeks</strong> of use generally being as far as you want to go. If your cycle is extended past 12 weeks it’s normally best to substitute another anabolic hormone in Tren’s place in-order to keep progress alive; yes, our body will adapt. As for what you should stack Trenbolone-Enanthate with, simply pick whatever you want as this hormone stacks well with all anabolic steroids. However, it is highly recommended that testosterone be part of your stack as Trenbolone in any form will greatly suppress natural testosterone production. Many individuals also find supplementing with the T-3 hormone to be very useful as levels generally fall when Tren is present. Further, as responsible use is important a good Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan should occur after the cycle’s completion. In the case of Trenbolone-Enanthate, if your cycle ends with this steroid in play your PCT will not want to begin until at least 2 weeks have passed since your last injection.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">200 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Trenbolone Enanthate

It is produced endogenously by the anterior pituitary gland. Its growth-promoting effects are broad, and can be separated into three distinct areas: bone, skeletal muscle, and internal organs. It also supports protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and mineral metabolism, and can stimulate the growth of connective tissues.</p><p>It is most notably prescribed in cases of childhood growth disorders. Other uses include the treatment of short bowel syndrome, growth failure due to renal insufficiency, muscle wasting associated with HIV infection, and adult growth hormone deficiency.</p><p>Human growth hormone is also sometimes prescribed to healthy men and women who are aging. It may be given by either subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Human growth hormone is considered to be a controversial anabolic and performance-enhancing drug in the realm of bodybuilding and athletics. It is the fat-loss-promoting properties that are most obvious.</p><p>The drug can support muscle growth, strength gains, and increased athletic performance, but its effects are generally milder than those of anabolic or androgenic steroids. For a highly advanced athlete or bodybuilder, however, human growth hormone can help push body and performance further than might have been possible with steroids alone.</p><h3>Side Effects</h3><p>The most common adverse reactions to human growth hormone therapy are joint pain, headache, flu-like symptoms, peripheraledema (water retention), and back pain. Less common adverse reactions include inflammation of mucous membranes in the nose (rhinitis), dizziness, upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, tingling or numbness on the skin, reduced sensitivity to touch, general edema, nausea, sore bones, carpal tunnel syndrome, chest pain, depression, gynecomastia, hypothyroidism, and insomnia. The abuse of human growth hormone may cause diabetes, acromegaly and enlargement of the internal organs.<br /><br />Due to the growth promotion effects of human growth hormone, this drug should not be used by individuals with active or recurring cancer.<br /><br />Human growth hormone may reduce sensitivity to insulin and raise blood sugar levels. This may occur in individuals without preexisting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p>When used for physique-enhancing or performance-enhancing purposes, human growth hormone is usually administered at a dosage between 1 IU and 6 IU per day (2-4 IU being most common). It is designed for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.<br /><br />The drug is commonly cycled in a similar manner to anabolic/androgenic steroids, with the length of intake generally being between 6 weeks and 24 weeks.<br /><br />Other drugs are commonly used in conjunction with human growth hormone in order to elicit a stronger response.

As an anti-estrogen medication Arimidex belongs to the aromatase inhibitor (AI) family and it is by this designation we truly see the function of this medication. First brought to the market by AstraZeneca, Arimidex was created in an effort to combat breast cancer in post-menopausal women. As we are aware estrogen is the enemy when it comes to breast cancer and Arimidex actively reduces the amount the body produces and it is by this trait one can already begin to see how this might be useful in-terms ofanabolic steroid use. No, Arimidex is not an <strong>anabolic steroid</strong>; it is not a steroid in any shape or form but is commonly used in conjunction with anabolic steroids to combat estrogenic related side-effects.</p><h3>Arimidex:</h3><p>Anastrozole, commonly known as Arimidex is an aromatase inhibitor that actively blocks the aromatase enzyme by-which its duty cannot be performed, that being producing estrogen. By this inhibiting process the compound can actively reduce estrogen in the body by as much as 80%. Coupled with its estrogen reducing effects Arimidex also greatly increases testosterone in the body and can do so by as much as 50% by increasing total testosterone as well as Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) total output.</p><p>For the breast cancer patient this proves to be invaluable as decreased estrogen provides remedy, for in many ways breast cancer in very simplistic terms feeds off of the estrogen hormone. However, this same trait can also provide benefit to the anabolic androgenic steroid user in both hormone replacement patients who are very sensitive to <strong>testosterone</strong> treatment and of course to performance enhancers. Many anabolic androgenic steroids convert to estrogen due to the aromatase process and estrogen, while an essential hormone can lead to many unwanted side-effects when it is present in excess.</p><h3>The Benefits of Arimidex:</h3><p>By and large, as it pertains to anabolic androgenic steroid use the use and benefits of Arimidex greatly surround side-effect prevention. However, in men who suffer from low testosterone and who seek therapeutic remedy Arimidex can at times be a good choice, for as we discovered above the compound by its nature actively increases total testosterone output. Even so, while this remains true most men will find direct testosterone treatment to be optimal in treating their low levels and will generally require a regular dosing of an injectable or transdermal testosterone medication. In the case of low testosterone treatment most men will find the therapy well-tolerated and generally side-effect free; we must always remember, side-effects increase when dosing increases and as therapeutic dosing is very low the need for an AI is generally low in <strong>low testosterone</strong> patients.</p><p>Without question those who supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids for the purpose of performance enhancement will benefit from Arimidex use the most when comparing to therapeuticsteroid users. Performance enhancing doses are necessarily larger than therapeutic doses; after all, in therapy the idea is to return hormonal levels to normal but in performance enhancement the idea is to surpass them and to do so greatly. With such doses in mind the rate of aromatase greatly increases; no, not all anabolic androgenic steroids convert into estrogen but a vast quantity do and at varying rates depending on the steroid. By this conversion process when excess levels of the estrogen hormone buildup in the body some of the most common and well-known anabolic steroid side-effects may manifest themselves; including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Gynecomastia</li><li>Water Retention</li><li>High Blood Pressure</li><li>High LDL Cholesterol</li><li>Low HDL Cholesterol</li><li>Loss of Libido</li><li>Hair Loss</li><li>Fat Gain</li></ul><p>While some of these <strong>side-effects can be brought on by other factors, especially blood pressure and cholesterol, estrogen buildup can play a major role</strong>. For the majority of performance enhancing athletes the side-effects of steroid use that are of the greatest concern will remain Gynecomastia and water retention as these are the two most common but it is often in Arimidex they find remedy. As Arimidex blocks or as indicated by its name as an AI “Inhibits” estrogen buildup many of the common side-effects become nothing more than a memory or concern of the past. Think about it, if the estrogen that causes the side-effects is no longer present how can estrogenic related side-effects present themselves; they can’t, what doesn’t exist simply doesn’t exist.</p><p>Some performance enhancers, especially those who are looking to really add size to their frame often shy away from Arimidex out of a fear of losing or not obtaining gains. It is true, estrogen aids in the promotion of building muscle tissue and more importantly it is a hormone essential to our overall health, particularly our immune system. However, we are not removing all estrogen from our body through Arimidex use, we are simply reducing it, although greatly. Further, if you are going to supplement with <em>anabolic steroids</em> for the purpose of performance enhancement you need to ask yourself an important question; what’s worse, a few less gains or horrible unsightly side-effects? It is also important to note, while estrogen suppression will somewhat limit the amount of weight you gain it will not do so to the degree feared by many; not even close.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Arimidex:</h3><p>When it comes to side-effects it is always important to note all medications from every family carry with them a potential for side-effects; this includes everything to common cold medicine, pain killers, anabolic steroids and even AI’s such as <em>Arimidex</em>. However, when we examine Arimidex the potential for adverse side-effects appears to be very low. There do not appear to be any strong negative indirect side-effects due to supplemental use; however, use can lead to unwanted effects due to decreased estrogen in the body. In order for the human body to maintain a proper functioning endocrine system we must have some estrogen present. Further, decreased estrogen can have a negative effect on cholesterol, a very side-effect problem you are trying to prevent through use; as you may have guessed when it comes to cholesterol there is a very fine line as it pertains to the estrogen hormone. However, <strong>Arimidex</strong> doesn’t appear to affect this greatly in a negative way and therefore remains a positive choice in this regard.</p><p>For the majority of steroid users, those who supplement with Arimidex will not want to do so indefinitely in the name of safety; while it is generally side-effect friendly it is not a good idea to keep estrogen levels so suppressed for far extended periods of time. Most will find such AI’s should only be used while on cycle and discontinued once the cycle is complete in order to let the body return to normal hormonal production. If side-effects are not a problem for you then perhaps no Arimidex will be needed; however, for competitive physique athletes, even if they rarely suffer from anabolic<strong>steroid side-effects</strong> Arimidex can still be very useful, as reduced estrogen will provide a leaner and harder physique. For this reason many competitive bodybuilders supplement with Arimidex during their contest preparation diets.</p><h3>Arimidex and SERM’s:</h3><p>It is very common for Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM’s) to be thrown in the same anti-estrogen category as Arimidex and other AI’s but this is far from correct. SERM’s such asTamoxifen Citrate (Nolvadex) and Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid) do not inhibit the aromatase process in the body; they do not actively reduce the total amount of estrogen in the body. SERM’s such as Nolvadex or Clomid simply block estrogen from binding to certain receptors in the body and this can be a very useful tool; however, as you can see it is not nearly as strong since it has no reducing capability. Even so, SERM’s in the same light as AI’s actively increase or stimulate natural testosterone production and for this reason are commonly used during what is known as the Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan. Yes, both SERM’s and AI’s can be used for PCT purposes, the PCT purpose being largely to return testosterone production back to normal after it has been diminished through anabolic steroid use. However, we do not recommend AI’s for PCT therapy, even though they will increase testosterone greatly we prefer SERM’s for this purpose for one simple reason. During the PCT process we are not simply trying to <strong>increase testosterone</strong> but to normalize our entire hormonal production. As AI’s greatly reduce estrogen, a much needed hormone in the human body, we prefer SERM’s over AI’s to fulfill this purpose.</p><h3>Arimidex Cycles and Doses:</h3><p>Most who supplement with Arimidex will be doing so for the prevention of side-effects while on cycle or to tighten up their physique for a physique based competition by reducing estrogen in the body. Most men will find <strong>0.5mg</strong> every other day to be a good starting point while on cycle if it is needed for side-effect prevention with 1mg every other day generally being the most anyone will ever need for this purpose. However, if side-effects begin to manifest, particular Gynecomastia, many find supplementing with 1mg every day for a few weeks to be useful in combating this enemy; however, for this purpose we would in most cases recommend the slightly stronger AI Letrozole but Arimidex will often suffice. If this occurs, simply supplement with 1mg every day until symptoms pass; once they do drop the dose to every other day and finish your intended cycle. It should be noted, this is not a 100% failsafe plan; for some no amount of any AI on earth will protect from Gynecomastia.</p><p>The same dosing can be applied in physique sport competition, most notably bodybuilding; it is very common for many bodybuilders to supplement with Arimidex for <strong>12-16 weeks</strong> leading up to a competition at a dose of 1mg every other day. However, many bodybuilders will necessarily increase the dose to 1mg every day the final <strong>10-14 days</strong> before the show in order to ensure they are as hard and water free as possible. However, we cannot recommend anyone supplement with this compound at that high of a dose for an extended period of time, as such dosing for extended periods would be too much estrogen suppression.</p><p>Women in the physique sports world also sometimes supplement with <em>Arimidex</em> to provide a dryer and harder look but this will generally only occur a few weeks out from competition. Low doses for short periods of time can aid in a woman the same way it can a male competitor but as estrogen is slightly more important to a female use must necessarily be limited.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">1mg/1 tab.

slightly more powerful than Anavar it will prove to be milder than most all the rest. A DHT based steroid, it is very common to comparePrimobolan Depot (Methenolone Enanthate) to Masteron (Drostanolone) but this is an inaccurate assumption but if you know anything about anabolic steroids then you know assumptions run wild. Primobolan Depot does possess a higher anabolic rating than Masteron but the results tell a very different story. Generally speaking Primobolan Depot is a very weak steroid, much weaker than most other DHT based steroids. However, it is also one of the safest we can use and can be stacked with almost any other steroid imaginable. Primobolan Depot is not a steroid you will want to build your stack around but it can be a nice addition to a solid stack but when used alone, especially in males it will normally produce subpar results. While this is a very mild steroid there is an ora of greatness that surrounds it due to its rumored heavy use in the 1970’s among top bodybuilders but it’s important to understand, as great as these physiques were they were not built on Primobolan Depot alone.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Uses:</h3><p>Primobolan Depot proves to be a poor choice for most bulking cycles as it is not designed to increase size to any great degree. Yes, you can use it during your bulker safely but you would necessarily need to use a massive amounts and due to this steroid being one of the most expensive of all time this would not be an efficient choice. <strong>Primobolan Depot</strong> is so expensive you can expect to pay upwards of 3 times the amount as you would for testosterone and since massive amounts would need to be used for bulking this would destroy your wallet. For a cutting cycle things begin to change; obviously we will still be paying a fairly high amount for the steroid but we will not need to use as much to see results. Primobolan Depot does possess some decent anti-catabolic qualities as well as having the ability to increase nitrogen retention in the muscles which are both two fantastic qualities in any cutting cycle when calorie consumption is low. However, these same effects can be found in a greater degree with many other steroids; for the male steroid user who is wanting to serve this purpose, Masteron will prove to be a better choice andTrenbolone the best choice of all; however, neither of those steroids will prove to be as safe as Primobolan Depot.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Side-Effects:</h3><p>There are some general rules we can apply to anabolic steroids and <strong>side-effects</strong> that apply greatly to all steroids. The higher the dose the higher the risk of negative side-effects; further, the milder the steroid or the weaker in nature the milder its side-effects will be and Primobolan Depot makes no exception to these rules. As aromatizing is often a primary concern for many steroid users there is good news in this case; Primobolan Depot will not aromatize at all making estrogenic related side-effects no concern at all. Hair loss however is another story, this steroid can lead to it in a greater degree than many others but this will prove to be largely genetically based; meaning you were going to go bald anyway, Primobolan Depot only sped it up. Interestingly this steroid is also very <strong>side-effect</strong> friendly to female users; <strong>virilization</strong> can occur when too much is used for too long but most women who keep the dose low and short lived will be fine. Women who use Primobolan Depot and begin to see signs of virilization early on can reverse them if they discontinue use immediately but if you ignore them it becomes a different story.</p><h3>Primobolan Depot Myth:</h3><p>For reasons that make zero sense a myth surrounding Primobolan Depot has existed for years, that its use will not suppress natural testosterone production. Granted, it is true, this steroid will not shut you down as harshly as many others but it will still shut you down. Countless data has shown us Primobolan Depot decreases both Luteinizing hormones, as well as Follicle-stimulating hormones, both of which are essential for testosterone production; without these two hormones there is no testosterone. Understand this simple truth, we understand your very special and “Bro Science” has told you Primobolan Depot won’t shut you down but understand the reality is far from this assumption. For the slow, yes, it will absolutely shut down your natural testosterone production.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">100 mg/1ml (10ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Methenolone Enanthate 100

This steroid displays significant binding affinity for the progesterone receptor.The side effects associated with progesterone including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production, body fat gain and gynecomastia can occur.</p><p>The use of an anti-estrogen is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by progestational anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3><p>Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth.</p><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss.</p><p>Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity Side Effects</h3><p>TrenE (Trenbolone Enanthate) does not have hepatotoxic effects and therefore, liver toxicity is unlikely. Although unlikely, hepatotoxicity cannot be completely excluded, especially with high doses.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Side Effects</h3><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance in a direction that favors greater risk of arteriosclerosis.</p><p>The relative impact of an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism.</p><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p>To help reduce cardiovascular strain, it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active steroid administration. Supplementing with fish oils and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula is also recommended.</p><h3>Testosterone Suppression</h3><p>All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient to promote muscle gain are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production.</p><p>Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.</p><h3>Administration for Men</h3><p>It is most commonly used at a dosage of 150 – 300 mg per week. The dosage schedule can be further divided to reduce the volume of each injection if necessary, perhaps administering the drug two to three times per week. One should also take caution to rotate injection sites regularly, so as to avoid irritation or infection.</p><p>The positive effects of this drug become most apparent when it is used for longer cycles, usually lasting 8 weeks or more in duration.</p><p>TrenE (Trenbolone Enanthate) is a very versatile drug, and can be combined with a number of other agents depending on the desired result.</p><h3>Administration for Women</h3><p>TrenE (Trenbolone Enanthate) is rarely used with women in clinical medicine.</p><p>TrenE (Trenbolone Enanthate) is not recommended for women for performance enhancing purposes due to its strong androgenic nature and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.</p></div>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">200 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: TrenE

Each and every anabolic steroid can serve a primary purpose and will generally carry with it a few secondary qualities and the degree of each just like the steroids themselves can be quite varied. Of all the steroids we can discuss, from mild to strong, powerful and weak you’d be hard pressed to find a more exciting one than Trenbolone and of the various Trenbolone forms there is none more exciting than Trenbolone-Acetate. In-fact, if we were to label any anabolic androgenic steroid the perfectsteroid, side-effects aside it would undoubtedly be Trenbolone-Acetate.<br /><br />Like most anabolic steroids Trenbolone’s original intent was not performance enhancement but for the purpose of beefing up livestock and through this desire the hormone was born in the form of Finaplix (Fina) a subcutaneous implant that contained the hormone to be used in cattle. As you can easily see from its original intent, if the hormone was good for bulking up cattle it would be good for the same purpose in a human being and it was during the Golden Age of bodybuilding that it quickly rose to fame and popularity. However, it would not simply be Trenbolone’s raw bulking power that made it so popular but its true versatility, as it would prove to be and still to this day the most versatileanabolic androgenic steroid on the market. Most anabolic steroids serve a primary purpose, for example, they are primarily more efficient in bulking or in the dieting phase but most carry other traits suitable in a secondary nature for the other; there are very few anabolic steroids we would aptly label as pure bulkers or cutters. This is one of the things that make Trenbolone a little more special as it is equally efficient and effective for either type of cycle.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Acetate:</h3><p>Trenbolone-Acetate is a very powerful anabolic and androgenic steroidal hormone, so powerful it is 500 times more anabolic than testosterone as well as 500 times more androgenic; with this simple bit of knowledge we could stop right there and that would be enough to give you understanding of its true power. To understand the hormone a little more clearly we really only need to understand two things; the <strong>Trenbolone hormone</strong> and how the Acetate ester affects it and by this understanding there will be no doubt, it is the most powerfully amazing steroid of all time.<br /><br />Trenbolone exists by its structural alteration at the 19th position; simply meaning, the testosterone molecule has been altered at this point effectively making Trenbolone a 19-nor class anabolic steroid. By way of this alteration, like Testosterone, by its direct mode of action Trenbolone dramatically increases IGF-1 output but to a far greater degree than testosterone. As you understand IGF-1 is a very powerful anabolic hormone produced in all human beings and its role is so important it affects nearly every cell within the human body. In the case of Trenbolone, as it will cause massive amounts of IGF-1 to be released it will also firmly bind to the androgen receptors which in-turn greatly promotes both fat-loss and promotes growth. As you again understand most anabolic steroids have a positive impact on the metabolism and fat burning but in the case of Trenbolone this is one of the few<strong>anabolic steroids</strong> that burns fat in a direct manner; it actually directly enhances lipolysis. Tren, as it is more commonly known also plays a very important role the healing and regeneration process; this hormones ability to repair the cells is nearly ten times the amount of most anabolic steroids and as you understand it is the repairing and healing process that promotes enhancement in-terms of growth and strength as well as in the preservation of tissue when calories are restricted.<br /><br />Of all the traits Trenbolone carries and we’re hardly done yet, there is one that may truly stand alone and it is what is known as “Nutrient Efficiency” or “Feed Efficiency.” As you know food is the most anabolic substance any of us will ever take in; in the world of performance enhancement nothing is more important than the food we eat; in general, when speaking of performance, “enhanced” or not food is the most important factor. So a question might be what if you could take the same food you’re eating and make it more valuable? Look at it like this, what if every dollar you had could purchase two dollars’ worth of any product you desire; wouldn’t you want to know how to do this? Well, we can’t speak on actual dollars and cents but we can speak on food. When Trenbolone is present in the body every gram of food you eat becomes more valuable, each nutrient enhances in value and is used in a more efficient manner by the body and closer to its full potential capacity.<br /><br />As you can see this hormone carries with it some amazing traits and like most other anabolic androgenic steroids, especially those of a testosterone nature Trenbolone will increase nitrogen retention in the muscles, enhance protein synthesis and increase red blood cell count but to a far greater degree than other anabolic steroids. If all of this were not enough, like Testosterone<strong>Trenbolone</strong> also blocks the release and flow of glucocorticoid hormones, the hormones most commonly known as muscle wasting hormones.<br /><br />As you may be aware Trenbolone can come in several different forms, most commonly as Trenbolone-Acetate but fairly commonly in the form of <em>Trenbolone-Enanthate</em> as well. At one time what is now known as Tren-Hex was very popular, you may know it by its original name Parabolan but legitimate Parabolan is no longer manufactured. All Tren is the same in that it is all comprised of the same active Trenbolone hormone; however, the ester does play a few important roles but it does not change the direct nature of the hormone. As a small ester base anabolic steroid Trenbolone-Acetate will become active very quickly in the body; a mere few days of use and there will be no question you’re using Tren. Attached to the Acetate ester, one of the smallest esters we will ever use Trenbolone-Acetate has a half-life of approximately 3 days and this is very short, meaning every other day injections of the hormone are necessary and many will choose, although not completely necessary to inject the hormone on a daily basis. Further, as the Acetate ester is so small it takes up very little mass in the compound, meaning a larger portion of the compound will be Trenbolone than compared to other forms. This is true when we compare all large and small ester compounds but there is an interesting note regarding Tren. While we can adjust the dosing of any form to ensure we are getting the exact total amount of Tren we desire from any compound many individuals report not a only a stronger punch from the Acetate form but a smoother one as well.<br /><br />There is one more thing that needs to be mentioned; Trenbolone-Acetate carries with it one very distinct advantage over other Tren forms due to its small ester nature. Trenbolone, although very powerful can be very harsh on some users; we will delve into this more when we go over side-effects but if you are an individual who has a hard time with this compound and the side-effects become too much there is good news. As the half-life is so short you can simply discontinue use and all of the hormone will be out of your system in a few short days.</p><h3>The Benefits of Trenbolone-Acetate:</h3><p>The benefits of Trenbolone-Acetate can largely be summed up in one word “everything” for this is a steroid that carries with it just about every benefit you would ever desire out of anabolic steroid use. There truly is no hormone that can provide all the benefits of Trenbolone in such a strong and versatile fashion and when we use in conjunction with testosterone there is no stack of equal power.<br /><br />So what exactly can you expect? Individuals who supplement with Trenbolone-Acetate can expect massive <strong>gains in both strength and size</strong> and as this steroid does not aromatize at all any weight gain they garner will be pure lean muscle tissue. Further, because the gains are of such a pure form they will be much easier to hold onto once use is discontinued as compared to many other steroids that do not possess this trait to such a strong degree. This is one of the more common anabolic steroids used in bulking phases or what is commonly known as the off-season in bodybuilding and it is a perfect steroid for this time period but while it is a popular growth anabolic androgenic steroid it will be in the leaning out phase that is perhaps the most popular of all.<br /><br />When we diet our desire is not to simply lose body-fat, while this is the principle point of the diet a good diet will do all it can to preserve as much lean tissue as possible. When we diet some muscle tissue loss is going to occur, it is inevitable but our goal is to lose body-fat while minimizing this negative affect. This is where Trenbolone-Acetate can play a very important role as it may very well be the best anabolic steroid for preserving lean tissue while on a calorie restricted diet. Further, as an <strong>excellent preserver</strong>, as we discussed above <strong>Tren</strong> is also a pretty decent fat burner so it’s not too hard to see how one could bring forth a very impressive physique when this hormone is present.<br /><br />Trenbolone-Acetate also carries some traits that will be of particular importance to the competitive bodybuilder as well as the gym rat who simply desires a similar look and it revolves around vascularity and conditioning in-terms of hardness. Thanks in part to the massive ability to increase red blood cell count vascularity can become very pronounced in the individual who is already lean, much more so than without. Further, as it will readily harden a physique more so than most steroids we can safely say this may be the best steroid of all time when it comes to displaying a true hard and grainy like bodybuilding physique. Absolutely, there are other steroids that carry these traits as well but none to the degree of Trenbolone-Acetate and even when other steroids are stacked together they will not provide the effect as strongly and pronounced as Tren.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Trenbolone-Acetate:</h3><p>As you are aware anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them a possibility of adverse side-effects but most are generally unaware of how severe or mild they can be. You hear horror stories in the media of death and destruction, yet you see individuals who have supplemented for half a century and they’re just fine. Let’s be clear, yes, there are side-effects and no, they are nowhere near as severe as often purported and each and every anabolic steroid carries with it its own level of risk. Some steroids are so mild side-effects are almost unheard of and generally these steroids are going to be very mild in nature as well; that’s correct, more powerful anabolic steroids generally carry with them a higher level of probability (pure testosterone being the exception.)<br /><br />The Trenbolone hormone can be a little harsher than many other steroids but dosing will play a large part as will individual sensitivity. As Tren does not aromatize we have no need of concern regarding many of the most common steroidal side-effects such as <strong>water retention</strong> but <strong>acne and hair-loss can be as issue as can high blood pressure</strong>. As Trenbolone-Acetate will not aromatize most assumeGynecomastia will not be a concern but this is improper thinking; in-fact, you can form some horrificgyno with Tren if you’re not careful as this hormone is a progestin in nature and a powerful one at that. If you are sensitive to gyno flair ups with Tren a good aromatase inhibitor will work well here just as it would with Testosterone.<br /><br />When we speak of Tren’s possible brutality the above side-effects are not really our concern; in-fact, most who supplement with Trenbolone will be fine regarding the side-effects discussed above. When we speak of individuals simply not being able to take it because it can be too harsh the side-effects we are concerned with are insomnia, night sweats, rapid heart rate, anxiety and a loss of libido when the dose is too high. While some of these may not sound like a big deal you should view them in an amplified manner because if they occur they will do so in a very amplified way. Further, most who supplement with Trenbolone-Acetate will at some point “enjoy” one or more of such effects and for many it can simply be too much to handle. We must also mention, testosterone suppression is very strong with this steroid and it is highly advised that you supplement with exogenous testosterone any time you supplement with Trenbolone-Acetate.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Acetate Purchase:</h3><p>When we purchase anabolic androgenic steroids we will always want to purchase those of a human grade quality; after all, if it is human grade it was made in a sterile environment, is dosed properly and everything the bottle list is in there; nothing less and nothing more. Unfortunately human grade Trenbolone-Acetate will take you the rest of your life to find as it does not exist. Most will find they have two options; most commonly purchasing from an underground black market label and secondly making their own.<br /><br />Black market Tren, yes, there is a lot of counterfeit product which is odd since it doesn’t cost that much to make the real product but more commonly is either under-dosed or dirty Tren. Yes, there are many good underground Trenbolone-Acetate sources but if you choose this route you need to do your homework, ensure the source is of a quality nature and have a thorough understanding of the law as it pertains to where you live. If it is illegal for you to make such a purchase understand any possible fallout is your own responsibility.<br /><br />The second most common option is simply making your own and while not as popular as an underground purchase it is not that uncommon. Trenbolone-Acetate is one of the simpler anabolic steroids to make and Fina pellets can easily be ordered online or even purchased at your local Co-op and made into sterile and injectable Tren. However, sterility is the key and if any bacteria resides in your final solution you may indeed fall prey to an infection.</p><h3>Trenbolone-Acetate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Regardless of the type of cycle or intended purpose most will find <strong>6 weeks</strong> of Trenbolone-Acetate use to be the <strong>minimal time frame </strong>with 8 weeks being far more optimal. You can use it for longer periods but <strong>12 weeks</strong> will generally be all the Trenbolone anyone will ever want and should be reserved for more experienced users who understand how their body reacts. The strong majority of Trenbolone-Acetate users will generally find <strong>50mg every other day</strong> to be just about perfect, with<strong>100mg every other day</strong> being a good dosing for a more advanced athlete and user, especially one looking for more of a bodybuilding type physique. For higher end doses some will choose to go as high as 100mg every single day but most will never need this amount and if they do such an amount is best served towards the end of a bodybuilding contest prep cycle and diet in order to bring in ultimate hardness.<br /><br />You will find <strong>Trenbolone-Acetate stacks</strong> well with just about any other anabolic steroid imaginable but if there is anything you should stack it with it is some form of exogenous testosterone; the form of testosterone doesn’t matter, long esters, short esters and mixtures are all absolutely fine. Many individuals may also find Cytomel to be a useful addition to a Trenbolone stack as the hormone will slightly lower natural T-3 levels. No, this addition is by no means an absolute must but it can provide some useful benefits especially while dieting.<br /><br />Once your cycle ends and you are entering into you Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) if the cycle ends with Trenbolone-Acetate and all other steroids are of a small ester form you will be able to begin your PCT in a few short days. This gives Trenbolone-Acetate an advantage over Trenbolone-Enanthate, for if the Enanthate version were being used you would need to wait approximately 2 weeks before PCT began. Remember, the sooner we can start our PCT the better off we’ll be, in-terms of gains kept and our overall health.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> 1<span class=""editable"">00 mg/ml (10 ml vial)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Trenbolone Acetate 100

This steroid displays significant binding affinity for the progesterone receptor. The side effects associated with progesterone including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production, body fat gain and gynecomastia can occur.</p><p>The use of an anti-estrogen is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by progestational anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3><p>Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth.</p><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss.</p><p>Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. Testosterone Propionate is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor.</p><p>Trenbolone Acetate is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. This steroid displays significant binding affinity for the progesterone receptor.The side effects associated with progesterone including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production, body fat gain and gynecomastia can occur.

An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia is very rare even among sensitive individuals. Drostanolone Propionate as a non-aromatizable DHT derivative, may impart an anti-estrogenic effect, the drug competing with other (aromatizable) substrates for binding to the aromatase enzyme.</p><h3>Androgenic Side Effects</h3><p>Although classified as both anabolic and androgenic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth.</p><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss.</p><p>Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><h3>Hepatotoxic Side Effects</h3><p>Ripped does not have hepatotoxic effects and therefore, liver toxicity is unlikely.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Side Effects</h3><p>Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.

Supplementing with fish oils and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula is also recommended.</p><h3>Testosterone Suppression</h3><p>All anabolic/androgenic steroids are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.</p><p>Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones.

Chorionic gonadotropin is a polypeptide hormone normally found in the female body during the early months of pregnancy. As a clinical drug, HCG is used as an exogenous form of LH. It is typically applied to support ovulation and pregnancy in women, most specifically those suffering from infertility due to low concentrations of gonadotropins and an inability to ovulate. HCG is also used with men to treat hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a disorder characterized by low testosterone levels and insufficient LH output. The drug is also used in the treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism. HCG is used by male athletes for its ability to increase endogenous testosterone production, generally during, or at the conclusion of, a steroid cycle, when natural hormone production has been interrupted.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is generally given by intramuscular (IM) injection. The subcutaneous route is also used, and has been deemed to be roughly equivalent therapeutically to IM injections.<br /><br />When used to treat hypogonadotropin hypogonadism, either a short 6-week program, or a long-term program lasting up to 1 year, depending on the individual needs of the patient.<br /><br />Athletes use hCG either on cycle, in an effort to maintain testicular integrity during steroid administration, or after a cycle, to help restore hormonal homeostasis more quickly. Both types of use are deemed effective when properly applied.</p><h3>Post-Cycle</h3><p>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is often used with other medications as part of an in-depth Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) program focused on restoring endogenous testosterone production more rapidly at the end of a steroid cycle. If used for too long or at too high a dose, the drug may actually function to desensitize the Leydig’s cells to luteinizing hormone, further hindering a return to homeostasis.</p><h3>On-Cycle</h3><p>Athletes may also administer Human Chorionic Gonadotropin throughout a steroid cycle, to avoid testicular atrophy and the resulting reduced ability to respond to LH stimulus. In effect, this practice is used to avoid the problem of testicular atrophy, instead of trying to correct it later on when the cycle is over. It is important to remember that the dosage needs to be carefully monitored with this type of use.</p></div>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> 1 vial of 5000 IU dry powder + 1 amp. of 1 ml solvent</pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Avegnyl 5000

It is also one of the most popular performance enhancing steroids of all time the world over and if you’ve ever considered anabolic androgenic steroids there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Testosterone-Cypionate. As are all testosterone forms Testosterone-Cypionate is highly anabolic and androgenic with an anabolic and androgenic rating of 100 in each; in-fact, it is the anabolic and androgenic rating of testosterone by-which all anabolic androgenic steroids are measured. As Testosterone-Cypionate is just that, 100% pure testosterone, you will find it to be a perfect anabolic steroid for almost any purpose and one of the most efficiently well-tolerated anabolic hormones of all. As we look at this compound and try to gain an understanding you will find there are two key points of interest in gaining the knowledge you need; understanding the hormone testosterone itself and how the Cypionate ester that is attached affects it. By this understanding you will discover that all testosterone is virtually the same, as the hormone itself does not change due to the ester that is attached; the ester is not a hormone but rather a mechanism attached to the hormone that affects its activity and total action.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is one of the most important hormones any human being will ever produce and it is a hormone all human beings naturally produce, both men and women. While men require nearly ten times the amount of women, in both sexes the hormone plays host to numerous responsibilities in the body that range from muscle tissue growth and preservation, metabolic and sexual function to a host of others all comprising of a well-functioning endocrine system. Many individuals the world over suffer from <strong>low levels of the testosterone hormone</strong>, the most common cause being age. As men age their natural testosterone levels decline but this effect can be seen in women as well, especially women who are post-menopause and <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate </strong>is often the means by-which it is remedied. For the individual who suffers from low testosterone he or she may experience a host of problems ranging from muscle and strength loss, a loss of libido and sexual function, increased body-fat, depression, a weakened immune system to a host of other ailments and conditions. In most cases such conditions are easily treated by simply supplementing with a testosterone based hormone and by simply returning levels to a stable yet normal level will in most cases see such conditions resolved. In a strong sense we can look at TRT therapy in a similar light when examining performance enhancement, the difference simply being taking our testosterone levels beyond the normal range, thereby enhancing the effects of the hormone even more so. For the majority of performance enhancers this will revolve around muscle growth and preservation, increasing strength and overall athletic performance as well as <strong>improving metabolic activity within the body</strong>. <em>Testosterone-Cypionate</em> use is one of the best methods of achieving such goals as its direct mode of action simply promotes their enhancement. As is caused by the presence of testosterone the hormone dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis and further enhances red blood cells by increasing the amount and structural capacity. Testosterone also has the ability to block and reduce glucocorticoid hormones in the body, also known as muscle wasting hormones; the most famous of all being cortisol. These hormones, often referred to as “<strong>stress hormones</strong>” can have disastrous effects as they destroy muscle tissue and promote fat gain, all leading to slower metabolic activity and making fat-loss more difficult than it needs to be. Further and of particular interest, when the testosterone hormone is present in levels beyond therapeutic measure our natural IGF-1 levels increase and as IGF-1 is a powerful anabolic hormone itself, a hormone that plays a key role within every cell of the body, our total activity in both an anabolic and metabolic nature increases yet again. Now that you have an understanding of testosterone the obvious point of interest is how does the Cypionate ester play a role and function. The ester of the steroid is largely what determines the steroids half-life and the larger the ester the longer the half-life will be. The ester attached also affects a particular steroids initial activity but and while not of particular great importance it also affects the compounds total mass. The larger the ester the more mass it takes up in the compound; for example,<strong>100mg of testosterone with no ester attached is simply 100mg of testosterone whereas 100mg of testosterone with an ester attached will be a little less than 100mg of actual hormone</strong>; how much less will be determined by the size of the ester. In the case of Testosterone-Cypionate we have a compound that carries with it a moderately long half-life as Cypionate is a fairly large ester; the half-life of Testosterone-Cypionate is approximately 12 days long. As a long ester based anabolic steroid the effects of the compound will not be felt very fast but the total activity will stretch past much further than smaller ester based forms such as Testosterone-Propionate. To understand how the half-life works is fairly simple; <strong>when we inject 200mg of testosterone Cypionate, a very common dose per injection for any purpose, 12 days past this injection 100mg of active testosterone will be left in the body; as another 12 days passes 50mg of active testosterone will be left in the body and so on until no testosterone is left</strong>; this of course does not take into account further injections that may occur but is based on one injection so that understanding may be gained.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>It should be at this stage fairly easy to see the benefits of Testosterone-Cypionate and it doesn’t take a genius to see they are almost everything anyone could ever want out of anabolic steroid use. A common benefit often overlooked is the testosterone hormone’s <strong>ability to increase metabolic activity and in-truth this may be one of the greatest benefits of all and for all users of all purposes</strong>. For the HRT patient it allows him to garner a healthier physique pure and simple. For the performance enhancer it not only allows him to garner a more pleasing physique but one that is more efficient in nature; the higher our metabolic activity the more efficient our body becomes in most all aspects. Of course often the principle reason of supplemental testosterone use is to increase mass, strength and athletic performance and Testosterone-Cypionate will aid in every aspect and do so remarkably well; however, there are important things to understand. If you’re basing your understanding of Testosterone-Cypionate on popular culture references regarding anabolic steroids then all you need to do is grab a bottle, fill a syringe, inject and watch the show start; sorry, it doesn’t quite work this way. If you are after a true performance enhancing edge you still have to feed the body properly with adequate amounts of food and physical stimulation; through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate we simply enhance these aspects and increase the efficiency. For the TRT patient this might be a relief, for many TRT patients are petrified of testosterone therapy because they assume they’ll turn into the Incredible Hulk; if you do not feed and stimulate properly and in adequate amounts you have nothing to fear; further, HRT doses are typically too low to really do anything in this regard even if you do.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Cypionate:</h3><p>When examining the side-effects of Testosterone-Cypionate or any testosterone there is some good news right from the start; as testosterone is not a foreign substance it is not a hormone our bodies are unaccustomed to; you’ve been producing it at some level your entire life. Even so, when we enter into our body anything of an exogenous nature there is a potential for negative side-effects and the level of potential can vary with each and every item. The same can be said of all anabolic androgenic steroids, the level of potential varies with each and every one; nevertheless, while there is potential the probability is much lower than with many common over the counter medications, especially when we look at testosterone. Testosterone in many ways shouldn’t really be viewed as a drug, it doesn’t share any traits with what we use to determine if something is a drug and it’s not, it’s a hormone and there is a big, big difference. For healthy adult men most all will find that Testosterone-Cypionate is very well-tolerated when used responsibly; in-fact, numerous studies including those done by the New England Journal of Medicine have shown that even in supraphysiological doses the testosterone hormone can be used safely and without side-effects. While responsible use will always be best some individuals may find side-effects to occur and such side-effects caused by Testosterone-Cypionate will be of an estrogenic nature. Testosterone converts to estrogen once present in the body due to the aromatase process and by the buildup of estrogen problems such as <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and cholesterol issues can occur</strong>. While these can be very problematic many individuals will never have to take note of them while just as many will but fortunately we can easily do something about it. While total dose will play a large role so will individual sensitivity but in either case anti-estrogen medications can prove to be invaluable here; most notably and with the greatest authority aromatase inhibitors (AI’s.) An AI actively inhibits the aromatase process as well as reduces the amount of estrogen in your body; understand what doesn’t exist cannot convert and what cannot convert cannot lead to a negative effect. There is another side-effect we must mention and it is one that will affect every man; testicular atrophy. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids, including testosterone our natural testosterone production is suppressed and as testosterone is produced in the testicles, when this production is in decline the testicles shrink. However, through the use of Testosterone-Cypionate this is of no physical concern as our body is being supplied with all the testosterone it needs. Further, testicular atrophy does not imply shriveled up raisins, it simply means the total mass will be a little less and anyone who has ever supplemented with Testosterone-Cypionate before can tell you it’s really not that big of a deal. Most importantly, when use is discontinued the testicles will return to their normal size; as no exogenous hormones of an anabolic steroidal nature are entering the body natural testosterone production will begin again. However, this will generally prove to be useless information to the TRT patient as he will more than likely be on continuous <strong>testosterone therapy</strong> for the remainder of his life.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate vs. Testosterone-Enanthate:</h3><p>They are the two most commonly used Testosterones in both performance enhancement and TRT and two of the most commonly used anabolic steroids of all kinds the world over; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate. For years, decades even there has been a constant back and forth argument on which one is better and you will find individuals on both sides of the fence who swear up and down they are right; so the question is, which one is it? The answer, neither; Testosterone-Cypionate and Testosterone-Enanthate are almost identical in every single way, so closely related that any difference is of such an insignificant nature that the users could not possibly benefit more or less from one or the other. Look at it like this; you have two sandwiches made by the same person with the same ingredients, one was made right now and the other 32 seconds before; one comes with a pickle on the side; which sandwich is better? To give you a more specific understanding both are pure testosterone, both are attached to large esters and while <strong>Testosterone-Cypionate most commonly comes dosed at 200mg/ml</strong> and<strong>Testosterone-Enanthate most commonly comes dosed at 250mg/ml</strong> the individual can easily adjust the amounts to receive identical dosing with each. The only difference here lies within the half-life of each; recall, Testosterone-Cypionate carries with it a half-life of approximately 12 days while Testosterone-Enanthate carries with it a half-life of approximately 36 hours less; when we’re extending past a week in total half-life with only 36 hours difference this is meaningless. The truth is simple; the same dosing of each testosterone compound will produce identical results.</p><h3>Testosterone-Cypionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>Regardless of your purpose be it performance enhancement, TRT or a full blown HRT program you will be very hard pressed to find a better testosterone than Testosterone-Cypionate. In the world of TRT most will find 200mg every 7-10 days to be fairly common place and generally speaking about as high as you’ll ever go but of course in performance enhancing doses will necessarily be much higher. For the performance enhancer minimal dosing will generally be in the <strong>400mg-500mg per week</strong> range and most commonly split into two even doses twice per week; for example, for <strong>400mg total per week</strong> you might administer the hormone at 200mg on Monday and 200mg on Thursday continuing such a schedule until your total duration is complete. For many <strong>500mg per week</strong> will be as high as they ever need to go but in more hardcore circles it is not uncommon for doses to reach levels of <strong>1,000mg per week</strong> and at extreme elite levels, especially in competitive bodybuilding they can go much higher. Keep in mind, while the benefits of use will increase as the dose does so will the potential and probability of adverse effects. There is a strong risk to reward ratio at play and in the end you are the only one who can determine how far you want to go with that. Yes, absolutely anabolic steroids and especially those of a pure testosterone nature such as Testosterone-Cypionate can be used safely and effectively but responsible use will always prove to be the ultimate key. Part of responsible use will always include what is known as a Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) plan in order to normalize the body after use has been discontinued. Recall, the use of such hormones as Testosterone-Cypionate will suppress natural testosterone production but natural production will begin again once use is discontinued; however, such production will not begin instantly and there are things we can do to speed up the process. The sooner we get our natural production back up and running the more progress we made through our anabolic steroid use will be kept but most importantly our overall health will be protected; recall yet again, testosterone is essential to our health. This is where a good PCT plan comes in and it is by this plan we can stimulate natural production to begin; common supplemental items often include SERM’s such as Nolvadex andClomid as well as the hormone hCG.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> 30<span class=""editable"">0 mg/ml (vial 10 ml)</span></pre><div id=""short_description_block""><div id=""short_description_content"" class=""rte align_justify""><pre>Product name: Testosterone Cypionate 300 mg

in-fact, all anabolic androgenicsteroids owe their allegiance to the testosterone hormone, for without it they would not exist. Of all the forms of anabolic steroids it is testosterone that was first and regarding mass productionTestosterone-Propionate was the first to hit the shelves in mass quantity ready for human use. Testosterone-Propionate is one of the longest existing <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> and since its inception and into the present day it has remained one of the most popular of all time. Its popularity stems from many points but first and foremost it remains popular because it is simply pure testosterone, a hormone of great anabolic and androgenic power. Further, as we will shortly see testosterone is one of the more versatile hormones we can ever become acquainted with and while all testosterone forms are simply that, testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate holds a special place in the hearts of many performance enhancers due to its fast acting nature. Regardless of anything else Testosterone-Propionate is the easiest testosterone form to control, it is very easy to maintain stable levels, easy to control in-terms of side-effects and generally one of the more user friendly anabolic androgenic steroids anyone could ever choose. Thankfully the supply of Testosterone-Propionate is also through the roof as every underground lab and every steroidal compounding Pharmacy manufactures this testosterone compound making it one of the more readily available and affordable anabolic steroids.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Testosterone is a hormone produced by both men and women and is essential to our very functioning existence. As it is responsible for a host of functions we can see the majority of the functions when we examine low levels of the hormone and the negative effects it can cause. As for Testosterone-Propionate, what we have is identical to the testosterone hormone you naturally produced, the only difference being <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> is synthetically manufactured.<br /><br />How important is the testosterone hormone? Largely the examination of low levels can tell us everything we need to know and while low levels in of themselves are not life-threatening they can be beyond problematic and lead to many problems that can be life-threatening indeed; look at it like opening a door that should remained closed. Individuals who suffer from low testosterone and while more men will fall prey many women do as well, will often find symptoms such as increases in body-fat, loss of muscle tissue and strength, the inability to lose body-fat even when dieting and exercising, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction in men, a weakened immune system, lethargy, depression, a lack of mental focus, a lack of clarity of thought; the list goes on and on. Again, directly none of these conditions are life-threatening but you’d be hard pressed to make a positive argument regarding a single one. Further, it’s no secret, excess body-fat and a loss of muscle tissue is well-known to be the gateway to many serious physical problems, many of which are quite life-threatening indeed. An interesting note, in recent year’s low testosterone has also been linked to dementia, most notably regarding fatal Alzheimer’s disease.<br /><br />For the individual who suffers from low levels, when he supplements with testosterone and Testosterone-Propionate can be used for just that, he will in-fact see each and every area that was once found lacking improved upon and to a strong degree this is exactly how we can look at performance enhancing. For the performance enhancer the idea is simple, to take the <strong>levels of testosterone</strong> past what can be produced naturally thereby enhancing the traits and functions for what it is responsible for greatly. It really is that simple and is nowhere nearly as complicated as many like to make it out to be.<br /><br />So how does it all work? By its nature and direct mode of action Testosterone-Propionate as a pure testosterone form greatly increases nitrogen retention in the muscles as well as overall protein synthesis. Both of these traits are key factors in building lean tissue as well as preserving it and as lean tissue increases so does our overall metabolic rate. If nothing else this makes the hormone immeasurable in-terms of how truly beneficial it is but as you may have guessed its direct mode of action goes much deeper.<br /><br />Testosterone-Propionate will dramatically reduce and inhibit the release of glucocorticoid hormones in the body. This is important because these are the hormones that destroy muscle tissue and promote the storage of body-fat; while you may not be familiar with all glucocorticoid hormones you’ve probably heard of one, the most famous of all, cortisol. By supplementing and increasing ourtestosterone levels through the use of <em>Testosterone-Propionate</em> we now have less cortisol in our body; again, promoting greater metabolic activity.<br /><br />Testosterone also plays a key and vital role along with IGF-1, a naturally produced peptide hormone of immense anabolic power and importance. IGF-1 effects nearly every single cell in the human body and the more testosterone in your system the greater release of this peptide hormone there will be. IGF-1 also play a direct role alongside another peptide hormone, the most famous of all, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and it is the release of IGF-1 that plays a very important role in how much HGH you produce.<br /><br />While this gives you a general understanding of the testosterone hormone you still need to understand the Propionate ester. Propionate is not a steroid, it is not a hormone, it is an ester that can be attached to a hormone and testosterone is not the only one. Propionate is one of the smaller esters we have available, not the smallest but pretty close; of the most common esters used the only smaller ester most will use will be Acetate. As a small ester based testosterone, Testosterone-Propionate will become active and noticeable very quickly and as to be expected will carry a very short half-life; meaning, the total duration of activity is very short lived, thereby making frequent administration necessary. Testosterone-Propionate carries a half-life of approximately 4 days and will need to be administered at least every 3 days with every other day being far more optimal. Further, as more of an interesting note, as the Propionate ester is so small it will take up very little mass in the compound; meaning a larger portion of the compound will be pure testosterone. For example, 100mg of Testosterone-Propionate will yield more usable testosterone than 100mg of a larger ester based form such as Testosterone-Cypionate. In the end, while worthy of note it is of little consequence since dosing can easily be adjusted to receive the same amount with any form.</p><h3>The Benefits of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>As Testosterone-Propionate is just that, testosterone it is for all intense purpose one of the very few perfect anabolic androgenic steroids. Individual goals can greatly vary from treating low testosterone, performance enhancement, bulking, cutting, improving athletic performance or simple vanity and<strong>Testosterone-Propionate</strong> can have a place in each and every one. As is evident from the hormones description above Testosterone-Propionate can greatly add muscle mass, increase strength, improve metabolic efficiency, improve athletic performance and grant you a greater sense of well-being; is there really much more you could want? Further, because Testosterone-Propionate is such a fast acting anabolic steroid, while most will tolerate it very well if you are one of the few who does not for whatever reason, simply discontinuing use will be very simple as the hormone will clear in just a few days.<br /><br />By-and-large the simplest way to look at the benefits are as we discussed above; when we understand what testosterone is responsible for we then understand why it’s important to make sure levels are adequate if they are lacking. Further, regarding performance enhancement when we understand again what the hormone is responsible for we understand very easily how increasing our levels increases its efficiency by in-which it functions, we literally enhance the performance of the testosterone hormone.</p><h3>The Side-Effects of Testosterone-Propionate:</h3><p>Anabolic androgenic steroids carry with them possible side-effects and as Testosterone-Propionate is an anabolic androgenic steroid it too carries with it possible <strong>side-effects</strong>. However, it is very important to remember testosterone is not akin to taking medicine; although steroids are often labeled “Drugs” such a label is somewhat haphazard. As you recall, testosterone is a hormone you naturally produce and have so your entire life and by basic logic the presence of testosterone will generally be very well tolerated. Even so, when we present to our body anything in exogenous form there is always some level of risk; how great the risk varies from each and every item and in the world of anabolic steroids the level of risk varies with each and every one. In the case of Testosterone-Propionate, as it is very well-tolerated in most healthy adult men most will not have any problems; however, responsible use will always be the safest route to follow. Of course it must be noted, “responsible use” can mean quite a few different things to different people but nevertheless, there are facts and there are real life experiences we can pull from to gauge our choices.<br /><br /> Of the possible side-effects you will find they most commonly include <strong>Gynecomastia, water retention, high blood pressure and issues of a cholesterol nature as well as testicular atrophy</strong>; testicular atrophy being the one guaranteed side-effect in all men. Testicular atrophy occurs for one simple reason; the presence of anabolic androgenic steroids, even testosterone suppresses natural testosterone production. As testosterone is produced in the testicles and production comes to a halt the testicles simply shrink in size; no, contrary to popular belief they do not shrink to where you can barely see them, we’re speaking of a slight decline is fullness. Once use is discontinued your testicles will return to their normal size as natural testosterone production will begin yet again.<br /><br />As for the other side-effects, they are by no means guaranteed but if they do occur they will do so because of the testosterone conversion process. Testosterone converts into estrogen via the aromatase process and as excess estrogen builds up such related side-effects can become problematic. Absolutely, the total dose of Testosterone-Propionate you take will play a big role; the more testosterone in your system the more testosterone there is to convert into estrogen. Individual sensitivity will also play a large role but there are things we can do if we are sensitive or as simple precautionary measures and none is better than supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor (AI.) An AI inhibits the conversion to estrogen and further reduces the amount of estrogen in the body; as the brunt of potential side-effects are brought on by estrogen you an easily see how and why this can be so beneficial.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Misconception:</h3><p>Go to any steroid related message board and you’ll find individuals who claim Testosterone-Propionate is better suited for cutting cycles and that longer ester based testosterones should be used when bulking; the point, do not listen to these people. Testosterone-Propionate can be used for any cycle, as can pretty much any testosterone form; Testosterone-Propionate is a perfect steroid because <strong>it is pure testosterone and it is not the ester that deems it better for one purpose or the othe</strong>r. It is true, some people will hold a little less water when they use this small ester version but in most cases any water problems can be controlled with diet and the use of AI’s. As for bulking, again, as this is pure testosterone and testosterone is the best agent for a bulking cycle Testosterone-Propionate can be perfect. Yes, you’ll need to inject frequently regardless of the end goal but sometimes this isn’t really a bad thing. Frequent injections of small ester based anabolics are often much easier to control in-terms of maintaining stable and peaked levels of a particular hormone. In the end, when making your choice you’ll find Testosterone-Propionate to be a fine one regardless of anything else but other forms can be just as good.</p><h3>Testosterone-Propionate Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3><p>For the Testosterone Replacement Therapy candidate generally dosing will fall in the <strong>100mg-200mg per week</strong> range and rarely surpassing this amount. However, as frequent injections are necessary most physicians will generally opt for larger ester forms, most commonly Testosterone-Cypionate so the patient only has to inject once per week.<br /><br />For the performance enhancer the dosing will be much larger and the varying levels will be much wider too but he must necessarily inject frequently as discussed if he is going to maintain stability. Generally the minimal dose when supplementing for performance purposes will be 100mg every other day with <strong>200mg every other day</strong> being as high as most will ever go. Yes, you an absolutely take more, there is no set in stone amount but understand such high-end doses can open up the doors to side-effects that you may have wished to remain shut. In elite level competitive sports, especially in elite level bodybuilding it is not uncommon to see doses surpass a 2,000mg per week range but this can be very harsh and there is simply no way such a dosing could ever be recommended in a responsible manner.<br /><br />As with all cycles, as natural testosterone production will be suppressed, once use is discontinued and responsible use will include breaks Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) is a must in order to aid and speed up the recovery process. This is where Testosterone-Propionate has a bit of advantage over many other forms of testosterone; as a small ester that clears very quickly if your cycle ends with Testosterone-Propionate and there is no other long ester gear present in your system your PCT plan can start almost immediately. Remember, the sooner we start our PCT the better off we’ll be and such rapid PCT application cannot be accomplished with long ester based testosterone.

Largely thanks to the massive media attention the drug has received over the years but more so due to the idea surrounding Winstrol as a Cutting steroid. Lets be clear, almost any anabolic steroid can be used to Cut or drop body-fat; the use of the words <strong>Cutting Steroids</strong> should only be taken with a grain of salt and that includes when talking about Winstrols.</p><h2>Overview of Effects</h2><p>Winstrol is an anabolic steroid with very low androgenic qualities yet highly anabolic. Its strengths lie within its ability to promote increases in strength, as well as harden an already lean physique. This hardening effect is what has led Winstrol to be known as a Cutting Steroid in many circles but make no mistake, Winstrol will not magically rip you to shreds; you must possess already low levels of body fat for it to give your body a harder more defined appearance. Yes, absolutely, Winstrol can help you achieve a lower body fat but all anabolic steroids can do this with just as much success. Winstrol is a long standing favorite of the bodybuilding world due to its hardening effects but somebodybuilders swear by it even in their off-season as a means to solidify gains or to increase strength during a cycle, thereby enabling them to push more weight and grow. However, although this is not the most common use of the drug it is also not recommended. Winstrol is one of the most toxic anabolic steroids to the liver and cycles of Winstrol are best run for short durations of six to eight weeks and not during Bulking cycles; save Winstrol for other purposes. Beyond the bodybuilding world <strong>Winstrol</strong> has firmly placed itself on the pedestal of most well-knownanabolics on the planet thanks to its use in professional sports by individuals in just about every professional sport imaginable. Winstrol as we discussed can greatly increase strength and this includes an increase in ones strength of speed. Further, due to its inability to promote massive gains in muscle tissue, it is a drug that can be used in low doses without generating a lot of suspicion. More importantly, Winstrol is only detectable for a very short period of time and is very, very easy to cover up if a drug test is made known to the athlete; these things make Winstrol a top choice for many professional athletes and for obvious reasons. It should be noted, the <strong>drug Winstrol</strong> and the <strong>drug Stanozolol</strong> are one in the same. <strong>Stanozolol is the official drug name</strong>. Many anabolic steroids carry a name based on the name of their original producer, for example the drug commonly known as Dianabol is specifically and more correctly known as Methandrostenolone; the same concepts applies here with Stanozolol or as you know it, Winstrol or Winstrol Depot.</p><h2>Effects of Winstrol</h2><p>Like all anabolic steroidal hormones the effects of Winstrol can be broken down into two distinct categories; the positive effects and adverse effects. By its nature, as we will see the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a stronger physique; such a trait can be perfect for an athlete looking for more strength and speed. Further, the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a better looking physique making it an excellent contest prep bodybuilding steroid and one for gym rats desiring a similar looking physique. Of course this steroid is not without fault as the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Such effects can range from common DHT related, to liver toxicity and of course natural testosterone suppression. Of course the hormone can be used safely and while some side-effects are indeed very genetically based revolving around individual response, most who supplement responsibly will have very few if any serious problems. Let’s take a look at the effects of Winstrol and discover how we can best maximize the effects within this DHT based steroid.</p><h3>The Positive Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Without question the primary positive effects of Winstrol revolve around strength and overall athletic performance; in-fact, it is athletic performance that has made this steroid so popular. This increase in strength can be translated into direct physical power, speed and simply a better performing athlete. No, the hormone will not create non-existing talent; it will simply enhance the talents already in place. Like all anabolic steroids the effects of Winstrol do not create an athlete, they simply enhance already existing athletic talent. Beyond performance athletics this steroid has a welcomed home in the physique inspired world as the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote this end. While a very poor mass building steroid the effects of Winstrol in this regard largely surround dieting phases. Winstrol is very apt for preserving lean tissue and strength when calories are restricted; ask any bodybuilder and he’ll assure you this is a more than welcomed trait. Further, by its nature the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a harder and more vascular look; key components to the physique game. Of course it must be noted this hormone will not make a fat physique ripped. To enjoy these physique enhancing qualities the athlete will need to be fairly lean to begin with if they are going to show; contrary to popular culture belief anabolic steroids are not magical.</p><h3>The Adverse Effects of Winstrol:</h3><p>Like all anabolic steroids the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Of course simply stating adverse reactions may occur is not enough, factors such as individual response, total dosing and time of use must be taken into consideration. For example, the higher the dose and the longer we supplement the greater potential there is for negative effects; this may sound obvious and perhaps over simplistic but these are factors many choose to ignore. What are the possible adverse effects of Winstrol use? A few of these are guaranteed, some are genetically dependent and one is very individual based on behavior. The effects of Winstrol in this category include:</p><ul><li>Cholesterol Issues: Winstrol can lower your HDL and increase your LDL. Those who already have cholesterol issues should avoid this steroid. Those who do not, who supplement responsibly and live a lifestyle that promotes healthy cholesterol levels will not have any problems.</li><li>Liver Toxicity: As a C17-aa anabolic steroid the effects of Winstrol include liver toxicity. This occurs due to the structural change associated with all C17-aa steroids. While unfortunate this structural change is necessary for the hormone to survive ingestion and administration. By this nature liver enzyme levels will increase when the hormone is used. However, if we are responsible in our supplementation, as the liver rejuvenates quickly enzyme levels will return to normal shortly after use is discontinued leaving no permanent damage. It is however highly advised you avoid heavy alcohol consumption when this hormone is in play.</li><li>Hair-Loss: As a DHT based anabolic steroid those predisposed to hair-loss may find they lose some hair with Winstrol supplementation. Those who are not predisposed will not lose the first hair on their head. Put simply, if you lose any hair you were going to lose it anyway; the Winstrol simply sped it up.</li><li>Acne: Another DHT based effect and again it will be of concern to those genetically predisposed. The majority of people will have no problem but if you are acne sensitive this steroid may cause breakouts. For this reason it is important you keep your skin very clean and always ensure your product is of a clean and pure nature.</li><li>Testosterone Suppression: For some reason many performance enhancers believe the effects of Winstrol do not include testosterone suppression; we assure you it does. For this reason you are highly encouraged to seek out remedy with exogenous testosterone use being your best bet.</li></ul><h2>Winstrol Cycle</h2><p>A Winstrol cycle is one of the most common anabolic steroid cycles of all. Somewhat mild in nature when compared to many other anabolic steroids this is a steroid well-suited for strengthening athletes in all sports and a very good bodybuilding contest prep hormone. While the basic Winstrol cycle has been part of sports for a very long time it reached new levels of popularity during the 1988 Summer Olympics when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, the hormone that makes Winstrol. While not the best bulking steroid for men a Winstrol cycle can be successfully run by female athletes in both bulking and dieting phases and as such is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be used safely by women. Regardless of sex or specific purpose of use a Winstrol cycle can provide fantastic gains to help you achieve your desired end. Let’s delve in and see what we can find.</p><h3>Injectable &amp; Tablet Forms:</h3><p>A solid Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) based anabolic hormone, Stanozolol can be commonly found in both injectable and tablet form. Regardless of the form you have the same Stanozolol hormone and your Winstrol cycle will be just as effective with either form. It is true that the injectable form is slightly more potent and on this basis some will always choose this form for their Winstrol cycle. Further, as a very liver toxic steroid due to its C17-aa nature many assume the injectable is a safer option. Let’s be clear, while slightly more potent in its injectable form the difference is negligible at best. As for liver toxicity, the injectable form of Stanozolol is also of a C17-aa nature just like the tablet; both forms are highly liver toxic. When you’re planning your Winstrol cycle the only thing that really matters is ensuring your product is of a high quality nature; beyond this the form does not matter.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Women:</h3><p>While anabolic steroid use can be very dangerous for women due to virilization effects, Winstrol remains one of the few choices females have at their disposal. Virilization symptoms appear to be much lower when supplementation is of a responsible nature but we must stress while the odds are in your favor virilization may still occur. If such symptoms begin to show the athlete should discontinue use immediately before they set in permanently. Most women will find a Winstrol cycle of 6 weeks in length to be sufficient at a dosing of 10mg every other day to every day depending on the athlete, desired end and response to the hormone. Some women may be able to tolerate as much as a 20mg dose but they should be forewarned that virilization will become a stronger reality. While a Winstrol cycle can be a solid option for the female athlete Anavar still remains our primary choice for female athletes.</p><h3>Winstrol Cycle for Men:</h3><p>For the male Winstrol cycle, regardless of purpose of use 6-8 weeks of total use will normally suffice. For athletes looking for a boost in performance a dosing of 50mg every other day will in most all cases provide what they are looking for. Of course some will want more and if more is needed and this will be common in competitive bodybuilding circles or simply those looking for a similar physique a dose of 50mg every day can provide this end. As for doses of a higher nature, 100mg per day is the most Stanozolol any man will ever want to take and such a dose can only be recommended for very short periods of time. Such a case might be for a competitive bodybuilder right before his competition, say the last 10-14 days leading up to the show. In all cases most men will find this to be a poor mass building steroid as the very nature of Stanozolol will not readily promote this end. It can have bulking benefits due to its ability to increase synergy between other anabolic steroids but due to it being so toxic to the liver use should be limited to specific and most beneficial times. If one will save his Winstrol cycle for such phases of use he will most certainly find the hormone to be highly beneficial.</p><h2>Winstrol Pills</h2><p>Winstrol pills are one of the most common forms of the anabolic steroid hormone Stanozolol if for no other reason than their ease of use. While available in an injectable solution as well, in either case pill or injectable you have the same Stanozolol hormone at hand. While ease of use may make Winstrol pills more popular than the injectable form in many circles what truly makes this one of the most popular steroids of all time is simply by the way it functions. The Stanozolol hormone is not well-suited for building mass, in-fact, it won’t do much at all in this regard but the traits and benefits it will bring to the table are worth their weight in gold to most any performance enhancer.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills &amp; the Injectable Myth:</h3><p>It’s commonly understood that as a C17-aa anabolic steroid Winstrol pills are very toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is the truth. However, it is commonly believed that the injectable form commonly known as Winstrol Depot is not toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is a myth. The injectable form is also of a C17-aa nature, in-fact, you can actually administer the injectable form orally simply by drinking it. In both cases, Winstrol pills or Winstrol Depot you have the same Stanozolol hormone in a C17-aa form by-which is necessary for the hormones survival in the body. As such the total time of use should be limited and dosing should always be of a responsible level. If you can hold to this practice any effect the hormone has on your liver enzymes will not be of a permanent nature as the liver has amazing rejuvenating qualities.</p><h3>Winstrol Pills Dosing:</h3><p>Winstrol pills are most commonly found in 50mg and 10mg tablets. Regardless of the pills potency the same Stanozolol hormone is in each pill. Generally 10mg tablets will be perfect for female users as the average female dosing is 10mg per day. Some females may be able to tolerate 20mg per day for short periods of time but such a dosing can greatly increase the probability of virilization symptoms. Conversely most men will find 50mg Winstrol pills to be perfect for their needs as the average male Stanozolol dose is 50mg per day. If 50mg Winstrol pills are not available simply take the number of 10mg pills needed to meet your desired dose.</p><h3>Optimal Use:</h3><p>As a very poor bulking agent Winstrol pills will be best served when used in cutting cycles. During cutting cycles where calories are restricted the Stanozolol hormone will greatly promote tissue preservation and rejuvenation. Further, as a steroid apt towards strength, during a diet strength will be greatly preserved. Moreover, in the name of conditioning Winstrol pills will greatly promote a leaner and harder physique making this one of the more popular bodybuilding contest prep steroids. While cutting cycles are a fantastic use, Winstrol pills remain very popular in athletic circles for the purpose of simply enhancing overall athletic performance. Again, as increasing strength is this steroids greatest attribute and since strength is the end all be all for athletes this can be a fine choice. Further, as mass will not be built to a large degree and many athletes see mass as a hindrance in-terms of its effects on performance as well as the prying eyes it can invite this again makes Winstrol pills a fine choice.</p><h2>Winstrol Results</h2><p>You hear talk regarding anabolic steroids all the time but often it is in a very general sense. When most people talk about anabolic steroids visions of monstrous behemoths come to mind but what many fail to realize is that not all steroids meet this end. There are steroids that are far more suited towards building lean mass than others, there are steroids that will do more for strength and very little for mass; in the end, how big you get really boils down to how big you eat. For example, let’s examine the anabolic steroid Stanozolol commonly referred to by its most popular trade nameWinstrol. For those who supplement with this powerful DHT derived steroid Winstrol results while powerful will not translate into massive gains in size. Even in massive doses, which no one would recommend as such would be dangerous and pretty much a waste, Winstrol results will still not lead to the behemoth mentioned a few moments ago. For many this may be surprising; after all, most do not understand anabolic steroids but the truth is simple, each anabolic steroid is a little unique.</p><h3>Athletic Winstrol Results:</h3><p>The Stanozolol hormone has been very popular in the world of competitive sports for decades; we’re talking about everything from football to baseball and even track and field; in-fact, it is track and field that gave this steroid world renowned popularity. The reason is simple; Winstrol results in increased strength and increased speed in the athlete. This not only enables the athlete to train harder but garners him the ability to perform his desired sport at the highest level. To put it simply, while it may sound very simplistic it’s the easiest way to look at it; Winstrol results in a more effective and efficient athlete. No, it will not make a terrible athlete a great one; this is something many fail to understand about anabolic androgenic steroids in general; it will however allow and enable the athlete to perform at his or her peak potential of which cannot be obtained without.</p><h3>Primary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>When supplementing with this steroid the primary Winstrol results will be that of an increase in strength. Such an increase can be translated into direct physical power, the ability to move more weight and it can also be translated into more speed producing a faster athlete. As this is the primary trait it remains Stanozolol is one of the most popular anabolic steroids among performance athletes; so much so it finds its way into most any sport and in amounts that would probably blow your mind. It is true, while supplemental use of Winstrol results in very little mass increase some lean tissue may be gained but as this steroid does not aromatize each and every ounce gained will be that of pure lean muscle mass. With strength still being the primary trait dieting athletes, especially those of a physique nature may find this trait to be very beneficial. When we diet our strength generally declines as calories are restricted. When you diet you’re taking in fewer calories than you need to maintain your weight and often strength pays the price. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in such strength being greatly preserved as the hormone will aid in preserving lean muscle tissue. Of course the leaner we get the harder this will become but you can guarantee you’ll hold onto a lot more strength with this hormone in play than if not.</p><h3>Secondary Winstrol Results:</h3><p>In some ways lean tissue preservation could be placed in this category as strength is the primary trait but it also fits here. As we hold onto more lean tissue when dieting our metabolism is enhanced and as Winstrol results in a faster metabolism by the manner in-which the hormone performs in the body our metabolism is enhanced all the more. You may be thinking we’re putting too much emphasis on metabolism but for those who understand how difficult burning body-fat can be while trying to maintain lean tissue these people understand how invaluable metabolic related traits can be. Other secondary Winstrol results also fall into the dieting field. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in a harder and more defined physique and one that is more vascular to boot. This makes the Stanozolol hormone very popular in competitive bodybuilding circles as a lean, hard and vascular physique is the name of the game. We must stress and would be remised to leave this out; Winstrol will not magically turn a fat physique into a granite statue, you must already be somewhat lean to display these physique related traits. However, while that is true, if you are lean you will find Winstrol results in a much more impressive physique than a physique that is absent the hormone.</p><h2>Winstrol Side-Effects</h2><p>Moderately mild in nature, the hormone Stanozolol is one of the more popular anabolic steroidsamong avid performance enhancers; you know it best as Winstrol. Generally best served used in cutting cycles or as a direct athletic performance enhancer due to its ability to increases strength, while moderately mild Winstrol side-effects are very real indeed. While adverse Winstrol side-effects may occur they are by no means guaranteed. There are many factors that must be considered and if responsible use is implored you will find this is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be safely used by most any athlete. An anabolic steroid of the DHT class Stanozolol will not aromatize at all making common steroidal problems such as Gynecomastia and water retention of no concern; with that in mind, let’s take a look at the possible Winstrol side-effects and discover what we need to know.</p><h3>Severe Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>Of all the possible adverse Winstrol side-effects issues surrounding cholesterol will prove to be the most serious of all. As you understand cholesterol is generally broken down into two categories, LDL, the bad cholesterol and HDL, the good cholesterol your body needs. The Stanozolol hormone can have a negative effect on both cholesterol readings and those who are predisposed to cholesterol issues or who already suffer from a poor condition should avoid this steroid like the plague. To combat these possible cholesterol issues we must keep our total dosing at a responsible level and limit the time of use to a responsible time frame. Further, following a diet that is cholesterol friendly will do more for you than anything else; those who fail to do so even when their Stanozolol use is of a responsible nature may find they fall prey to problems.</p><h3>Liver Related Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>It is generally commonly understood that the Stanozolol hormone is of a strong hepatic nature; simply put, of all the adverse Winstrol side-effects it remains liver toxicity is one of the most common. By its very existence the Stanozolol hormone belongs to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroidal hormones. This is classification is defined by a structural alteration to the hormone that allows it to survive ingestion; without such a structural change the hormone would be destroyed before any benefit could take place. While this structural change allows the hormone to survive its first pass through the liver it also makes it very toxic; it is a tradeoff and one that is unavoidable. It is a common misconception held by many performance enhancers that only the oral form of this hormone is hepatic in nature; this is an outright lie. Just as the oral form is C17-aa so is the injectable; in that there is no difference. When we supplement with this steroid our liver enzyme readings will go up; how much will be determined by total dosing and total time of use but they will go up none the less. For this reason, again, we must maintain a level of responsible use. For those who supplement in a responsible fashion there is some very good news. The liver has amazing rejuvenating capabilities and once use is discontinued, assuming the individual has been responsible liver enzyme levels will normalize and no permanent damage will be done. It should also be noted, during the course of use heavy alcohol consumption should be avoided; in-fact, laying off alcohol completely is probably not a bad idea.</p><h3>The Myth &amp; the Truth:</h3><p>One of the reasons Stanozolol remains so popular is because many believe Winstrol side-effects do not include testosterone suppression; how this myth started is unclear but it is a myth just the same. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production will be suppressed. Certain steroids will have a stronger effect in this regard but suppression will occur just the same. If you supplement with Winstrol your levels will fall and this is not only unhealthy but can be detrimental to your cause. For this reason some form of precaution is advised with exogenous testosterone use being your absolute best bet.</p><h3>DHT Based Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3><p>As a DHT based anabolic hormone both hair-loss and acne can be a very real possibility; in-fact, these may be the most common Winstrol side-effects of all in-terms of visual effects. Assuring your product is clean and of a pure nature will greatly protect you from acne, as will keeping your skin extra clean; however, those who are genetically sensitive to acne may still have a problem. Those who are not genetically sensitive and who supplement with a pure product will in most all cases be fine. As for hair-loss, it is true, this is one of the primary Winstrol side-effects but it is not as cut and dry as you might think. Like acne, hair-loss is very genetically dependent. Those who are predisposed to male-pattern baldness run the greatest risk; men who are not should not lose the first hair on their head. If you are genetically predisposed to hair-loss, simply put you were going to lose some of your hair to begin with; the Stanozolol hormone simply caused this to occur sooner than it would have otherwise.</p><h2>Winstrol Stacking</h2><p>Winstrol stacking is very popular among many performance athletes as the Stanozolol hormone by-which it is comprised, is highly beneficial. In most cases Winstrol stacking will be reserved for cuttingcycles as this compound has very little use when it comes to trying to pack on size. Of course beyond cutting cycles many athletes simply use the hormone to enhance overall athletic performance; in-fact, this is one of its most common uses. However, it remains cutting cycles will be the most common point of use for Winstrol stacking as the majority of performance enhancers are physique based inspired; we’re not simply talking about bodybuilders but gym rats as well and they are the majority. We have broken down some Winstrol stacking examples for your benefit. We have provided you examples for both beginner and advanced use as well as male and female use. That is correct, Stanozolol is one of the very few anabolic steroids that can be used by women and as such Winstrol stacking is very popular among female athletes in a host of arenas. While all of this remains true our examples will be somewhat of a general nature as we cannot give you an example for each and every individual to meet their specific needs; however, for the brunt of you these Winstrol stacking plans will meet your needs to a tee.</p><h3>Female Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>While females can absolutely supplement with the Stanozolol hormone safely precaution must be applied. The general concern regarding anabolic steroids and females is virilization and fortunately Winstrol, while carrying a possibility will generally do so mildly. If a female supplements responsibly in most cases she will be fine but as we are all unique individuals, individual response will play a role. There will be some women who cannot touch this steroid even at a low dose and if problems begin to occur, you are urged to discontinue use. If you discontinue the moment problems arise they will dissipate and you will be fine. It is when these problems are ignored that they set in permanently. For most women 10mg every other day to even every day in some cases will be all the Stanozolol they need. However, some women will be able to tolerate as much as 20mg per day but this should only be tried by very experienced, very advanced and only in athletes who are in desperate need. Most women will never have a need to go above 10mg per day. We have provided two Winstrol stacking examples; a beginner to Stanozolol use and one who is more advanced with anabolic steroid cycling:</p><ol><li>Female Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/eod WK 7-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li><li>Female Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/ed WK 3-8 Primobolan Depot 100mg/wk WK 5-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li></ol><h3>Male Winstrol Stacking:</h3><p>For the male athlete his Stanozolol use will fall in a bit of a different form; generally we will see use of this hormone at the back half of a cycle rather than early on in female use. Further, as it is a poor bulking choice for men, although it can benefit a woman during this time, for a man it will always be cutting cycle related. In many cases it is a bit inaccurate to label a particular steroid a bulker or a cutter but when it comes to male Stanozolol use we can make an exception; for male Stanozolol use this is a cutting steroid. The majority of men will find 50mg every day to be the perfect dosing for all their Winstrol stacking needs. Regardless of experience this will be our standard dose. Of course those who are looking for a slight anabolic bump to aid in athletic performance may only need this dose every other day and some may only need 25mg every other day; even so it remains 50mg every day will be our gold standard. Again, we have provided you two examples of Winstrol stacking, one for a beginner and one for an advanced anabolic steroid user:</p><ol><li>Male Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 400mg/wk WK 7-12 Winstrol 50mg/ed WK 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 400mg-500mg/wk</li><li>Male Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 200mg/eod WK 1-8 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 200mg-250mg/eod WK 9-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg/eod WK 9-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 100mg/eod</li></ol><p>*Note: Physique competitors may find bumping the Winstrol up to 100mg/ed the last 10-14 days to be beneficial but this would be the longest period and only reason for such use. Competitors may also find increasing the Trenbolone use to every day the last 10-14 days to be highly beneficial as well. **Note: Male Winstrol stacking examples have not included possible SERM’s, AI’s, Growth Hormone, or fat-burning agents such as Clenbuterol and Cytomel (T3) that may be highly beneficial as well; we have only focused on the steroidal part of the plan.</p><h4>***Abbreviations:</h4><p>- WK: Week - MG: Milligram - eod: Every other day - ed: Every day</p><h2>Winstrol Tablets</h2><p>Winstrol tablets are a popular form of the anabolic steroid known as Stanozolol; a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived steroid of immense popularity. Very popular among performance athletes in almost all sports its popularity is even larger among the millions upon millions of avid gym rats the world over. Of course you might think that’s an overstatement, hardly; in the U.S. alone over six-million American adults supplement with anabolic steroids for the purpose of performance enhancement and as Winstrol tablets are of a mild and generally of a tolerable nature you better believe millions are supplementing with them. To give you some understanding as to why so many supplement let’s take a look at Winstrol tablets and see what we can unveil.</p><h3>Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>A DHT based anabolic steroid, Winstrol tablets belong to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroids as well. The C17-aa classification refers to a structural change of the hormone at the 17th carbon position that is necessary to allow the hormones survival; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver. While necessary this structural change makes C17-aa steroids rather liver toxic; in the case of Winstrol tablets we have one of the most toxic of all. However do not let your heart be troubled yet; remember, even Tylenol is toxic to the liver and we must think in relative, realistic and responsible terms. The truth is simple; the liver possess amazing rejuvenation abilities and with responsible use, although liver enzyme levels will increase during use they will return to normal very quickly once use is discontinued; again, assuming use is of a responsible nature. If that’s not enough to ease your mind regular alcohol consumption of a heavy nature is far more toxic to the liver than Winstrol tablets and it’s safe to say a lot of you don’t think twice about it. Beyond its DHT and C17-aa nature Winstrol tablets carry an active half-life of approximately 9 hours making daily administration necessary if we are to maintain stable levels of the Stanozolol hormone. When we do the hormone will perform in a highly anabolic manner with very low androgenic activity. By its function Winstrol tablets greatly increase nitrogen retention in the muscles, increase protein synthesis and dramatically lower SHBG allowing more free-testosterone to be used by the body.</p><h3>When to Supplement with Winstrol Tablets:</h3><p>By its nature Winstrol tablets are not powerful mass builders; in-fact, they will do very little to promote significant growth. However, some growth can be obtained, largely due to the lower SHBG factor and by the manner in-which Stanozolol creates synergy with other anabolic steroids being used. Further, as this steroid does not aromatize at all any weight gained due to use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue; it simply won’t be much and as it is so toxic to the liver use is best served for other purposes as other options are more efficient for bulking. Without question the two best times to supplement with Winstrol tablets is during a cutting cycle or a cycle designed to enhance overall athletic performance. To begin, Winstrol tablets will promote an increase in strength, as an athlete that is the name of the game; stronger and faster. It will not take a lot of this hormone to achieve this; most men will find doses of 25mg-50mg every other day to be all they need with most women only needing 10mg every other day. While enhancing athletic performance is a good use for this steroid it remains cutting cycles are the most common point of use as the majority of performance enhancers are enhancing simply to build a better physique. During a cutting cycle one will necessarily be consuming a restricted amount of calories in-order to burn fat. As calories are restricted losses of lean tissue and strength are sure to occur. Through supplemental use of the Stanozolol hormone we are able to preserve a great deal of our lean tissue and strength, thereby further enhancing our overall metabolic rate and burning even more fat. Moreover, by the manner in-which the hormone exist, when lean enough we will display a much harder and well-defined physique and for a physique minded individual there is not much more you can ask for. For this purpose most men will find a dose of 50mg every day to be more than sufficient with most women again only needing 10mg every other day, with daily doses being tolerated well in some specific cases.</p><h3>The End Game:</h3><p>Whatever your purpose of use may be you’ll find Winstrol tablets to meet your needs and effectively so. Generally you’ll find the steroid to come in both 10mg and 50mg forms but you’ll also commonly find it available in a water base injectable solution known as Winstrol Depot. If you find the Deport version available to you nothing changes regarding what we have discussed here; it is the same DHT based Stanozolol hormone, it performs identically to Winstrol tablets and like the tablets is also a C17-aa anabolic steroid. In either case and for any purpose it is important to remember responsible use will always be your best friend.</p>","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> 5<span class=""editable"">0 mg/tab.

<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What is Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
Somatropin is a form of human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is important in the body for the growth of bones and muscles.

Somatropin is used to treat growth failure in children and adults who lack natural growth hormone, and in those with chronic kidney failure, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature at birth with no catch-up growth, and other causes. Somatropin is also used to prevent severe weight loss in people with AIDS, or to treat short bowel syndrome.

Somatropin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What is the most important information I should know about Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
Before you receive somatropin, tell your doctor about all your past and present medical conditions, especially allergies, trauma, surgery, diabetes, cancer, breathing problems, liver or kidney disease, scoliosis, high blood pressure, pancreas disorder, underactive thyroid, or a brain tumor.

Also tell your doctor about all other medications you use, especially steroids or diabetes medications. Your dosages of these medicines may need to be changed when you start using somatropin. Do not stop using a steroid suddenly or change any of your medication doses without your doctor's advice.

If you have Prader-Willi syndrome and are using somatropin, call your doctor promptly if you develop signs of lung or breathing problems such as shortness of breath, coughing, or new or increased snoring.

Call your doctor at once if you have sudden and severe pain in your upper stomach with nausea and vomiting, fast heartbeat, increased thirst or urination, weight loss, or vision changes and sudden, severe pain behind your eyes.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before using Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
Before you receive somatropin, tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a growth hormone medicine, or to drug preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, metacresol or glycerin.

You should not use this medication if you are allergic to somatropin, or if you have:
<ul>
 	<li>diabetic retinopathy (a serious eye condition caused by diabetes);</li>
 	<li>cancer; or</li>
 	<li>Prader-Willi syndrome and are also overweight or have sleep apnea or severe respiratory (lung) problems.</li>
</ul>
You should also not use somatropin if you have a serious medical condition after having:
<ul>
 	<li>open heart surgery or stomach surgery;</li>
 	<li>trauma or other medical emergency; or</li>
 	<li>breathing problems (such as lung failure).</li>
</ul>
To make sure you can safely take somatropin, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions:
<ul>
 	<li>liver disease;</li>
 	<li>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</li>
 	<li>diabetes;</li>
 	<li>a pituitary gland disorder;</li>
 	<li>scoliosis;</li>
 	<li>high blood pressure (hypertension);</li>
 	<li>a pancreas disorder (especially in children);</li>
 	<li>a history of cancer;</li>
 	<li>carpal tunnel syndrome;</li>
 	<li>underactive thyroid; or</li>
 	<li>a brain tumor or lesion.</li>
</ul>
FDA pregnancy category B. Some brands of somatropin are not expected to harm an unborn baby, including Genotropin, Omnitrope, Saizen, Serostim, and Zorbtive.

FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether certain other brands of somatropin will harm an unborn baby, including Humatrope, Norditropin, Nutropin, and Tev-tropin.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this medication.

It is not known whether somatropin passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Do not use somatropin without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>How should I use Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
Use exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.

Your dose and brand of somatropin, and how often you give it will depend on what you are being treated for. Follow the directions on your prescription label.

Somatropin is injected into a muscle or under the skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not self-inject this medicine if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.

Use a different place on your body each time you give the injection. Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject the medication. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Do not inject this medicine into skin or muscle that is red, sore, infected, or injured.

Do not shake the medication bottle or you may ruin the medicine. When mixing somatropin with a diluent (liquid), use a gentle swirling motion. Do not use the medication if it has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your doctor for a new prescription.

Use a disposable needle only once. Throw away used needles in a puncture-proof container (ask your pharmacist where you can get one and how to dispose of it). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.

To be sure this medication is helping your condition and not causing harm, your blood and growth progress will need to be tested often. Your eyes may also need to be checked. Visit your doctor regularly.

If you are being treated for short bowel syndrome, follow the diet plan created for you by your doctor or nutrition counselor to help control your condition. Somatropin is not a cure for short bowel syndrome.

If you use a form of somatropin that comes in a cartridge for use with an injection pen, use only the pen injection system provided with the somatropin brand you use.

How you store this medicine will depend on what brand you are using and what diluent you are mixing somatropin with. After mixing somatropin, you may need to use it right away or you may be able to store it for later use. Read and carefully follow the instructions provided with your medicine about proper storage of somatropin before and after it has been mixed. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about proper storage of your medication.

Throw away any somatropin left over after the expiration date on the label has passed.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What happens if I miss a dose?</strong></span></h2>
Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.

Call your doctor if you miss more than 3 doses in a row.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What happens if I overdose?</strong></span></h2>
Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.

Overdose can cause tremors or shaking, cold sweats, increased hunger, headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, fast heartbeat, and nausea. Long-term overdose may cause excessive growth.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What should I avoid while using Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
If you use Zorbtive to treat short bowel syndrome, avoid drinking fruit juices or soda beverages. Follow the instructions of your doctor or nutrition counselor about what types of liquids you should drink while using Zorbtive.

Avoid drinking alcohol if you have short bowel syndrome. Alcohol can irritate your stomach and could make your condition worse.
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>Genotropin (somatropin) side effects</strong></span></h2>
If you have Prader-Willi syndrome, call your doctor promptly if you develop signs of lung or breathing problems such as shortness of breath, coughing, or new or increased snoring. Rare cases of serious breathing problems have occurred in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who use somatropin.

Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:
<ul>
 	<li>severe pain in your upper stomach spreading to your back, nausea and vomiting, fast heart rate;</li>
 	<li>increased thirst, increased urination, hunger, dry mouth, fruity breath odor, drowsiness, dry skin, blurred vision, and weight loss;</li>
 	<li>sudden and severe pain behind your eyes, vision changes;</li>
 	<li>swelling in your head, face, hands, or feet; or</li>
 	<li>numbness or tingling in your wrist, hand, or fingers.</li>
</ul>
Less serious side effects may include:
<ul>
 	<li>headache, feeling tired;</li>
 	<li>redness, soreness, swelling, rash, itching, pain, or bruising where the medicine was injected;</li>
 	<li>pain in your arms or legs, joint stiffness or pain;</li>
 	<li>muscle pain; or</li>
 	<li>cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>What other drugs will affect Genotropin (somatropin)?</strong></span></h2>
Before using somatropin, tell your doctor if you use insulin or take oral (by mouth) medicine to treat diabetes. Somatropin may affect blood sugar levels and you may need to adjust your dose of the diabetes medication. Do not change the dose of your diabetes medication without your doctor's advice.

Tell your doctor if you use any type of steroid medicine such as cortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, and others. Steroids can make somatropin less effective and your doses may need to be adjusted. Do not stop using a steroid suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions.

<h1>Dianabol</h1>
<h2>(Methandrostenolone, Methandienone)</h2>
It is one of the oldest anabolic steroids ever created and since its appearance it has remained one of the most popular of all time and for good reason; there is truly nothing else quite like it! Originally brought to us by Ciba Pharmaceuticals, thanks to U.S. Olympic Team doctor John Zeigler, Dianabolor Dbol as it is commonly known was the first oral anabolic steroid ever created. While manyanabolic steroids were first synthesized with a therapeutic medical purpose in mind this is not the case with <strong>Dbol</strong>, in-fact, Dianabol was brought forth for one reason and one reason only, performance enhancement and with that in mind you better believe it held up to the desired end. For years the Soviet Union had dominated U.S. Olympic Teams through their use of testosterone and Dr. Ziegler was charged with coming up with an answer and his answer was one of the most powerful anabolic steroids ever created and to this day it remains so. Originally and to this day a favorite among competitive bodybuilders and power lifters for its ability to add massive amounts of raw size and strength, since its inception Dianabol has found a more than welcomed home in almost every athletic circle and just as its demand was high in the 1960s its demand remains high today if not higher.
<h3>Dianabol:</h3>
Highly anabolic with a moderate androgenic nature Dianabol is comprised of the active steroidal hormone <strong>Methandrostenolone</strong> yet generally carries the popular trade name Dianabol, as is common in the anabolic steroid world. Well-suited for gains in both strength and size, by its very nature Dianabol by way of action through the androgen receptors greatly and dramatically increases protein synthesis and glycogenolysis, much more so than most other anabolic steroids and at a much faster rate. An anabolic steroid that generally comes in an oral tablet form, it can be found in an oral liquid state and even as an injectable solution but both are rare and 99% of all Methandrostenolone will be in the oral tablet form. As is the nature of most oral anabolic steroid tablets Dianabol belongs to the class known as 17-aa or 17 Alpha-Alkylated. In this particular instance this means the Methandrostenolone steroid has been altered at the 17th carbon position in order to allow the steroid to survive the first pass through the liver after ingestion. Without the 17-aa alteration this steroid would be useless as it would be destroyed by the body before it could ever enter into the blood stream. However, as is with most 17-aa steroids Dianabol is toxic to the liver and while the level of toxicity will vary greatly from one oral steroid to the next in the case of Dbol we have one of the more potent and toxic anabolics in our hand; the most toxic, not even close but far more than most. While liver toxicity can be a big concern, with responsible use such concern can be eliminated; Dianabol has been shown to only be effective for short periods of time and while liver values may increase when use is in place they will almost always drop back down to their original state once use is discontinued. How bad or strong is this liver toxicity; we cannot give you an exact number as liver values will vary from person to person and dosing will also play a large role; however, we can say with certainty that 50mg of Dianabol a day is not as toxic as daily alcohol consumption and its not even close. Most who supplement with this steroid will find 6 weeks of use to be the maximal duration and highly efficient, as well as generally safe; use that extends past the 6 week mark will often be a waste as the body will no longer respond to the hormone and a break from use must take place.
<h3>The Benefits of Dianabol:</h3>
As Dianabol was designed specifically for athletes and performance it should come as no surprise that the benefits which may be reaped are perfect for just that; athletic performance. It is true, Dianabol is not the only steroid we can say this about but most anabolic steroids were developed to treat a particular disease or ailment and often performance is a secondary concern if at all and while other steroids may have performance in mind to a degree, as it pertains to Dianabol this was the only thing in mind. While <strong>Dianabol</strong> provides many benefits, in simple terms the most important of all is in its ability to provide a rapid increase in fat-free mass and that means pure lean muscle tissue. As you recall Dbol greatly increases protein synthesis, a trait shared by most all anabolic steroids only here it is more pronounced but it is in Dianabols ability to greatly increase glycogenolysis that really sets it apart. Again, in simple terms this increase in glycogenolysis means your carbohydrates become more valuable, each and every gram of carbohydrates is utilized to a higher degree when Methandrostenolone is present in the body, far beyond what it could ever be in its absence regardless of how well you eat. For this reason, especially in competitive bodybuilding circles Dbol has remained a staple for many off-season bulking cycles as carbohydrate intake is normally much higher in the off-season than it is when dieting. Not only is this factor important in-terms of size gains but as carbohydrates are raw energy, this is their primary responsibility, we greatly increase our raw energy and translate it into an increase in strength and often dramatically so. While these benefits are all truly great it does not end there; Dianabol further dramatically increases nitrogen retention in the muscles of the body, as do most anabolic steroids but once again the rate in-which Dianabol pulls this off is nearly tenfold. From reading about these benefits the most obvious question is how truly great are they, can an actual number be provided that gives the above a little more weight? It is imperative to note, Dianabol will not cause a massive gain in size without enough fuel to perform the tasks at hand; however, even in a caloric deficit some increase in lean tissue and strength can occur. For those following a solid bulking diet and by solid we do not necessarily mean one that is massive, gains of 20-3olbs are not uncommon, in-fact theyre quite common with gains that surpass this mark while a little rarer not being unheard of. As is with most steroids Dianabol has one primary role but can serve more than one purpose, meaning in this case, yes, Dianabol can be used and used successfully when dieting and trying to lean out and this is not as uncommon as you might think. Competitive bodybuilders and power lifters will sometimes supplement with Dbol when dieting in order to maintain strength while in a caloric deficit; this can be very beneficial to a power lifter who needs to lose weight in-order to meet a desired weight class. Not only will dieting use of this steroid greatly aid in preserving strength but as often is the case it will greatly aid in preserving the tissue itself; as you can see, this is truly one amazing steroid.
<h3>The Side-Effects of Dianabol:</h3>
All anabolic steroids carry with them the potential for adverse side-effects and like all things in life the extent of this potential and probability greatly varies from one steroid to the next. In Dianabol we have a very powerful steroid and as is common the more powerful the steroid the more potential there is for side-effects; its a tradeoff but keep in mind, potential side-effects in no way means guaranteed or assured. This is the case with any item you might buy at your local RX, each and every item carries with it the potential for side-effects, some more so than others and while some will experience negative side-effects from one item, lets say Tylenol, many others will not. However, while side-effects from varying medications can vary, when we compare and discuss hormones of a steroidal nature it is not always so cut and dry for with anabolic steroids more times than not side-effects can easily be avoided or protected against with responsible use, while with many over the counter (OTC) medications this is simply not true; in OTC meds you can either take it or you cant, end of story. As we discussed Dianabol is one of the more liver toxic steroids on the market but the effects of its action in-terms of increasing liver enzyme levels are 100% reversible, assuming responsible use is adhered to. While toxicity is indeed a concern that is hard to ignore, without question the greatest threat to Dbol use is high blood pressure; in-fact, of all the side-effects caused by <strong>anabolic steroids</strong>high blood pressure and Dianabol can often go hand-in-hand. If you suffer from preexisting high blood pressure you should not supplement with this steroid; theres simply no way around it and the simple truth is this steroid is not for you. However, for the healthy adult male, even at a high dose many will find blood pressure to be of very little concern; there is absolutely no way to predict if you will be one of the many lucky ones but a healthy diet rich in omega fats, low in saturated fats, with adequate yet not high sodium and low in sugar as well as with the use of an aromatase inhibitor can greatly aid you in this end. Other common side-effects associated with <em>Dianabol</em> include excess water retention andGynecomastia most notably and for this reason yet again an aromatase inhibitor is highly advised to control and prevent such effects. Keep in mind, as it pertains to water retention, as most will use this steroid while bulking if water retention occurs most will blame the brunt of it on the steroid and in many cases this is simply not true. Most simply overeat, particularly regarding their carbohydrate intake and as carbs cause you to hold excess water when they are consumed in abundance excess water retention exists. Further, if you are supplementing with an aromatase inhibitor in adequate and regular amounts and still suffering from high water retention you can guarantee you are simply overeating. As you can see, side-effects from this steroid are very easily controlled, however there is one more we must mention and this one is absolutely guaranteed. Dianabol will suppress your natural testosterone production and if you desire to keep an adequate <strong>level of testosterone</strong> in your system, as you should exogenous testosterone must be applied. This is however very good news, as both Dianabol and testosterone have been shown to work together in great synergy and with this added benefit any testosterone concern becomes no concern at all.
<h3>Dianabol &amp; Anadrol:</h3>
They are the two most common and popular oral steroids of all time and for the purpose of bulking there are few that can come close to the power of Dianabol and Anadrol. Both of these very powerful steroids are often discussed together and in many circles you will find fans of both and often fans of Anadrol will swear up and down it is the more powerful of the two; however, this is simply not true. On a milligram for milligram basis Dianabol is far stronger than Anadrol; in-fact, its not that close; yes, both are very powerful but Dianabol takes first prize handedly. This common misconception regarding the two steroids exists for one very simple reason and that is common dosing protocol. Most all cycles that include Anadrol will start at 50mg per day with 100mg per day being very common place, while conversely most <strong>Dianabol cycles</strong> will start at 20-30mg per day and while they often go up to 50mg in more hardcore circles, for the average gym rat it is rare. You rarely hear of anyone supplementing with 100mg of Dbol per day outside of elite level bodybuilding but if an individual were to take both steroids, one during the first cycle and the other in a second cycle and at equal doses in both, assuming both forms were of pure quality and all other variables remained the same the gains made from Dianabol would shadow Anadrol into the ground. In the end, while Dbol is more powerful you must find what works best for you, find which you tolerate to a higher degree, regardless of power your personal toleration is of the utmost importance.
<h3>Dianabol Cycles &amp; Doses:</h3>
For the majority of performance enhancers Dianabol will be used during an off-season bulking cycle; after all, by its nature it is primarily a bulking and strength increasing steroid; keep in mind, it can be used when cutting but bulking is where it truly shines. By its nature Dbol is a very fast acting steroid, so fast the effects can be seen in a matter of a few days; after a week there will be no question Dianabol is in your system and if you know anything about anabolic steroids then you understand this is very fast. However, as a fast acting steroid you may have already guessed it carries with it a very short half-life and youd be guessing right as this steroid carries with it a half-life of approximately<strong>5 hours</strong> making it one of the fastest acting and shortest lived anabolic androgenic steroids on the market. By this short half-life dosing of Dianabol should be multiple times per day reaching your total daily dose with the last dose spread out evenly throughout the day. It should come as no surprise, as this is a fast acting anabolic steroid many will choose Dianabol at the beginning of a cycle to kick the cycle off or what is often referred to as priming the cycle and while this is very effective and the most common place of use we must label another period of use superior. Dianabol is one of the best plateau busters on the market; with any cycle gains will come but at some point you will stagnate and changes must be made either in diet and training or in the anabolic stack; sometimes all three. However, in many cases if the individual simply added a little Dbol at the sticking point of the cycle they would see progress do just that, progress once again and if there is any place this steroid truly shines it is as a plateau buster while on cycle. The dosing of Dianabol can vary greatly but we can safely say to see any true anabolic affect <strong>20mg per day</strong> will prove to be the minimal dose with <strong>100mg per day</strong> being the maximal dose ever used and only used in certain circumstances by experienced steroid users. For the majority of performance enhancing athletes 50mg per day will prove to be all the Dbol they ever need and in some cases more than they need; if you are only looking for a slight bump in performance or size 50mg may indeed be too much. For the beginner most will find <strong>20-30mg per day</strong> to be all they need and in many cases all they ever want. There is one more factor we must discuss and this may be one of the most important of all and that is real Dianabol. Dianabol is one of the most common steroids on the black market, as its demand is very high and the raw powder from which it derives is one of the absolute cheapest to obtain. For those reasons you better believe there is a lot of under-dosed product on the market; demand is high and while powder is cheap most labs know suppliers are easily fooled and they will cut the tabs down to almost nothing and sell it to you at full price. It is somewhat rare for Dianabol to be outright counterfeited though, as powder is cheap theres not a lot of desire to counterfeit this product but in the name of greed it still occurs but it is low dosing that is the most common. Beware of where you purchase your Dianabol, always purchase human grade and always be aware of the laws as they pertain to where you live; follow these guidelines and youll save yourself a lot of trouble and enjoy one of the greatest steroids on earth.
<h2>Dianabol Cycle</h2>
The simple Dianabol cycle, while simple is one of the oldest and most popular anabolic steroid cycles of all time and for two simple reasons; it can produce amazing gains and rapidly so. Since its inception this little steroid pill has changed the face of athletics and physiques and while many othersteroids have come and gone Dbol as it is most commonly known has stood the test of time. When you stop and think about it this shouldn’t really come as a surprise; after all, the hormone was brought to the shelves for the strict purpose of athletic performance. This is worthy of note simply because most anabolic steroids were not first synthesized for performance enhancement purposes, although generally speaking most end up filling this role in a primary fashion. So what can a Dianabol cycle do for you? Let’s take a look and it’ll be easy to see why so many supplement with Dbol.
<h3>Dianabol Cycle Benefits:</h3>
Those who run a Dianabol cycle will most commonly do so during a period of off-season bulking. Yes, you can run a Dianabol cycle during your dieting phase and successfully so but due to the primary functions of the hormone it will best serve a gaining phase. Put simply the benefits of Dbol are increases in both muscle mass and strength. Individuals who supplement with this steroid can often gain as much as 20lbs in mere weeks, sometimes even more if enough calories are consumed. Further, many will see their strength shoot through the roof; even if calories are not that high ones strength will typically increase tremendously. When we break down the benefits of a Dianabol cycle more specifically one important trait the hormone carries is in its ability to dramatically increase glycogenolysis. An increase in glycogenolysis can be very important to an off-season athlete; put simply this means each gram of carbohydrates you consume becomes more valuable as they are used in a more efficient manner. In short, with this increase, as carbohydrates are a source of energy we are able to tap into and utilize our energy reserves more effectively; this effect is largely what causes the dramatic increase in strength.
<h3>When to Run a Dianabol Cycle:</h3>
Generally, in most cases a Dianabol cycle will take place the first few weeks of a total anabolic steroid cycle as part of a total stack; 4-6 weeks of use at the beginning of a cycle is very common place and very effective. The idea here is simply to kick start the cycle and provide gains and benefits quickly on the front end while the slower acting steroids are building in your system. This can be a very useful and beneficial period of use and while very beneficial there is another period of use that may be more important. A solid course of Dbol during the middle of a cycle can do some pretty amazing things as this hormone is an amazing plateau buster. As you understand hitting walls where gains stop is very common; even when steroids are used you will at some point hit this wall. This is where a solid Dianabol cycle can be game changing as it will help you bust through the wall with force if used during this period for that purpose.
<h3>Sample Dianabol Cycle:</h3>
When you plan your Dianabol cycle the most obvious question is how much do you need to take; after all, if you take too little what’s the point in taking it and you obviously don’t want to take too much and develop horrible problems. For the first time Dbol user there is no point in getting crazy; a moderate dose of 20mg-30mg per day will suffice and produce amazing results; in-fact, in many cases this will be all the Dianabol ever needed even for advanced athletes. Of course some will want more and generally speaking 50mg per day will be as high as anyone will ever need to go. Of course understand the higher the dose the greater risk of adverse side-effects and this will be something you need to keep an eye on. Now we’re not saying you cannot run more than 50mg per day, you’ll find there are quite a few people who do but in the name of safety this is not something we can advise. Regardless of how much you take most will find 6 weeks of total use to be just about perfect. Further, most will find extending use past 6 weeks to be pointless as gains will not be very strong past the 6 week mark of a Dianabol cycle. We have provided you some solid Dianabol cycle plans as examples; these are not cycles and stacks we’re advising you to implement yourself; they are simply common stacks that appear to be satisfactory by those who run them. The first is a moderate plan, the second for someone with a little time in the saddle and will be as far as most want to take it. We have however added one final Dianabol cycle to the list, one that is very far advanced and that will only be implemented by a very small fragment of the performance enhancement population as it is one serious stack.
<ul>
 	<li>Basic Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 Dbol 25mg per day Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 500mg per week</li>
 	<li>Intermediate Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 30mg-50mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin 400mg per week Week 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate 750mg per week</li>
 	<li>Advanced Dianabol Cycle: Week 1-6 50mg per day Week 1-10 Deca-Durabolin Week 1-10 Testosterone-Enanthate 1,000mg per week Week 11-14 Dianabol 50mg per day Week 11-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 75mg every other day Week 11-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg every other day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dianabol Side-Effects</h2>
If it’s an anabolic androgenic steroid it will carry possible adverse side-effects this is a given but it is also not so cut and dry. While there are many possible side-effects in-which we can discuss, here we want to focus on Dianabol side-effects and Dianabol side-effects only but before we do there are several things we must consider and bring to the table. There are numerous forms of anabolic androgenic steroids and each one carries its own list of possible side-effects; while there are often strong similarities there are also unique factors to eachsteroid. Further, we cannot simply say “XYZ” steroid will cause such and such adverse reactions; possible side-effects mean just that, “possible” and by no means implies guaranteed. We must look at what the possible side-effects are, what the probability of such an effect occurring is, what we can do to prevent them and what we can do to reverse them should they occur. These are all important factors that are often left ignored in anabolic steroid discussion and that is irresponsible. We must also take into account individual response. As we are all unique human beings certain things will affect all of us differently. For example, you may be able to drink ten glasses of milk a day but then another man, if he takes even a sip he becomes very ill. Different hormones, different medications and even different foods affect all of us a little differently; if you put it into your body there will be a reaction but if adverse reactions occur this will vary from person to person. With all of this in mind we want to take a look at the Methandrostenolone hormone commonly known as Dianabol or Dbol. When we look at the hormone we will find it is generally very well-tolerated among healthy adult men who supplement responsibly; while there are possible Dianabol side-effects the rate of probability appears to be very low in healthy adult men who supplement responsibly. Even so, you need to know what these effects may be and how to combat them and that is exactly what we want to discuss.
<h3>Toxic Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3>
Dianabol belongs to the C17-Alpha Alkylated (C17-aa) family of anabolic steroids thereby making it toxic to the liver. The reason for this nature is simply by the manner in-which the hormone exist. The C17-aa nature is a structural change, simply put the hormone is structurally altered at the 17th carbon position in-order for it to survive the first pass of the liver after ingestion; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver and completely useless in every way. Unfortunately this change in the hormones structure will cause liver enzymes to increase during use due to this toxic nature. Before you freak out there are some things you may be interested in knowing. You may or may not understand but most anything you put into your body of an oral steroid or non-steroidal medication is toxic to the liver due to the manner in-which it exist. Further, while possessing a strong hepatic nature the Dianabol hormone is not nearly as toxic to the liver as many common over the counter medications and is nowhere near as toxic as daily alcohol consumption. However, due this nature we must limit our use of this steroid to short periods of use, normally 4-6 weeks of total use each time the hormone is used to ensure our liver remains healthy. Although your liver enzyme levels will increase with use, if you are responsible with dosing and total duration of use they will return to normal very shortly after use is discontinued.
<h3>Common Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3>
The most common Dianabol side-effects are largely due to the aromatase effect; simply put, the Dianabol hormone aromatizes causing a buildup of estrogen in the body. Make no mistake, estrogen is a very important hormone we need for proper function but too much can be very problematic. While this remains true we will also find these Dianabol side-effects to be very avoidable with proper use and while aromatizing plays a major role, other factors also can come into play with some of these Dianabol side-effects. The most common Dianabol side-effects include:
<ul>
 	<li>Gynecomastia</li>
 	<li>Excess Water Retention</li>
 	<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
 	<li>High LDL Cholesterol</li>
 	<li>Low HDL Cholesterol</li>
</ul>
- Gynecomastia &amp; Water Retention: to combat these Dianabol side-effects we have two options, SERM’s or AI’s with AI’s being far more effective. SERM’s such as Nolvadex act by binding to the receptors in the place of estrogen thereby preventing Gynecomastia, however, if you’re a little more sensitive all the SERM’s in the world will do very little for you; further, SERM’s will do very little regarding water retention. With AI’s such as Letrozole the aromatase process is inhibited and total estrogen is even reduced quite substantially. This not only protects against Gynecomastia and water retention but all of the common Dianabol side-effects to a degree. Of course it must be noted as it is often neglected in conversation; many who suffer from excess water retention blame it on the Dbol when in-fact the true culprit is their diet. If you’re eating too much, especially excess carbohydrates you’re going to bloat and if you’re supplementing with Dianabol you’re really going to bloat and hold water. In many cases if the individual simply cut his carb consumption down he’d save himself a lot of unwanted stress. - High Blood Pressure: The Dianabol steroid can be one of the harsher regarding blood pressure. If you already suffer from high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid; if you are sensitive to incurring high blood pressure you should not touch this steroid. Regardless of your condition you’re going to want to keep an eye on your blood pressure when this steroid is used. Many will not have the first problem; in-fact, many will be able to supplement with all they want without problems at all but others may see increases. Keeping estrogen under control can greatly benefit you as can simply living a healthy lifestyle that is blood pressure friendly. - Cholesterol: To combat these Dianabol side-effects the absolute best thing you can do is to live a cholesterol friendly lifestyle and this means eating properly. There are many foods that have been proven to be very cholesterol friendly such as foods in the Omega Fatty Acid family. Those who consume plenty of such foods and keep their estrogen levels under control will have a far better Dianabol experience.
<h3>Guaranteed Dianabol Side-Effects:</h3>
Of all the Dianabol side-effects there are two that are 100% guaranteed and that is testosterone suppression and testicular atrophy and the latter is dependent on the former. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production is suppressed and when production is suppressed, as testosterone is manufactured in the testicles our testicles atrophy. For this reason it is important to supplement with testosterone when we supplement with Dianabol, as testosterone is not only a beneficial hormone but one that is also essential to our overall health. When we provide our body with the testosterone it needs we will not suffer from any of the low testosterone symptoms; however, as we are not making our own testosterone our testicles will still lose a little of their fullness. While this remains true once all steroid use has come to an end the body will begin making its own testosterone again and our testicles will return to their normal size.
<h3>The End Game:</h3>
In the end, while Dianabol side-effects are real they are largely avoidable and controllable with responsible use and part of responsible use is proper dosing but perhaps of an even greater importance is simply the manner in-which you live. Living a healthy lifestyle will do more for you than anything else and if you can do this as well as supplement properly, assuming you’re a healthy adult male you will have in most all cases an enjoyable and positive experience. Of course it’s always important to remember as we’re all very unique individuals even if you are a healthy adult male you may not respond to the hormone in as strong of a positive fashion as the man next to you; most will be fine and enjoy this steroids benefits but as with all things in life there are exceptions.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

<h1>Anavar</h1>
<h2>(Oxandrolone)</h2>
One of the mildest and perhaps the most efficiently well-tolerated anabolic steroid on the marketOxandrolone has become very popular among performance enhancers, especially in the female community but remains a staple in the treatment of many muscle wasting diseases. Originally developed in 1964 by Searle Laboratories, (absorbed by Pfizer in 2003)the same manufacturer who brought us other well-known items such as Celebrex, Ambien, Dramamine and NutraSweet, Oxandrolone hit the shelves under the trade name Anavar and has been a favorite of many ever since. While Anavar is not a very powerful steroid, milligram for milligram it is one of the weakest ever made, it holds the distinction as being the most side-effect friendly with the strong majority of effects being only of a positive nature.
<h3>Anavar:</h3>
A member of the Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) family, Anavar is comprised of the active hormone Oxandrolone and possesses only a very slight androgenic nature; so slight it is almost non-existent but it is with its mild anabolic nature that many find use for this particular hormone. By design Anavar is a C17 alpha-alkylated (17-aa) anabolic steroid simply meaning the 17th carbon position has been altered in order to allow the medication to survive the first pass through the liver; without the 17-aa characteristic the medication would prove to be useless, as is common with most oral anabolic androgenic steroids. However, by its design <strong>Anavar</strong> is able to survive ingestion and enter into the blood stream where it becomes active and performs its varying functions within the body. As the 17-aa alteration is necessary for the hormones survival it is not without its disadvantages as this slight alteration is toxic to the liver; however, it is very important to note the toxicity of a particular 17-aa steroid will vary from one to the next and in the case of Anavar we have a 17-aa of a very mild toxic nature. Anavar is so mild in-terms of liver toxicity most who supplement or medicate with the Oxandrolone hormone experience little to no increases in liver enzyme readings during their period of use and any elevation will generally return to normal once use is discontinued. As an oral anabolic steroid, once ingested Anavar becomes active within the blood very rapidly, as is a very common trait among most oral anabolic steroids and especially those who carry with them a DHT nature. While initial activity is very fast total active duration is consequently very short as Anavar only possesses a half-life of approximately 9 hours making frequent dosing a necessity. With a 9 hour half-life most will find a twice daily administration of the hormone to be optimal if peak levels of the hormone are to be maintained within the blood. No, twice daily administration is not an outright necessity, once daily can still provide many benefits and many women whose doses will be fairly low often opt for this route, as well as many clinical patients. However, it is when we enter the world of male performance enhancement that multiple dosing per day proves to be more efficient, especially when we consider most men require a large amount to reap any reward.
<h3>The Benefits of Anavar:</h3>
Perhaps the greatest benefit revolving around the <strong>Oxandrolone</strong> hormone is its ability to treat muscle wasting diseases such as aids as it will greatly stave off muscle disintegration that is both common with such ailments and often one that causes a devastating end. Anavar can also be very useful in the treatment of burn victims enabling them to regain lost tissue but in some cases it may prove to not be enough and stronger anabolics are needed. While its medical purposes remain very simple, in the world of performance enhancement <em>Anavar</em> is not so cut-and-dry; in-fact, for the male performance enhancer looking to bulk up in size this is perhaps the last option he should ever consider. No, Anavar will not provide massive piles of muscle but what gains in size it does provide will be pure lean tissue and if you understand anything about performance each pound of lean tissue is worth its weight in gold. Even so, in the world of performance enhancement Anavar holds distinct qualities in both men and women but in many ways it is women who benefit the most, so much so in many circles it is often referred to as The Girl Steroid. Without question the greatest benefit to the <em>Oxandrolone steroid</em> is within its ability to preserve lean muscle tissue while simultaneously increasing total metabolic activity. With that in mind one can easily gather that during dieting or when intense activity is a regular basis this will be when the hormone proves to be the most useful. Anavar by its very nature greatly preserves lean tissue and as hard dieting often risk the loss of such tissue this trait is invaluable. Further and of equal importance, the Oxandrolone hormone actively increases metabolic efficiency, meaning the rate in-which we burn fat will be increased. These two primary effects prove to be very useful, especially when we consider them in total conjunction, for example:
<ul>
 	<li>The more muscle tissue we have the greater our metabolism</li>
 	<li>Dieting risk the loss of muscle tissue</li>
 	<li>Anavar <strong>preserves muscle tissue</strong></li>
 	<li>We now hold more muscle tissue while dieting, thereby maintaining greater metabolism</li>
</ul>
While Anavars metabolic and tissue preserving qualities are truly great, when we examine the hormone we can hardly say these are the greatest traits of all. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it is the hormones function within the female user that is such a welcomed one; so much so we will discuss it in detail in its own section below.
<h3>The Side-Effects of Anavar:</h3>
Anabolic Androgenic Steroids carry with them the potential for negative or adverse side-effects, this much is true but when it comes to Anavar the potential is low, very low. It is important to understand, Potential does not mean guaranteed, it does not mean the likelihood is great; it simply means a possibility exists and this is the case with all medications of every nature; when you buy anything at your local RX, from cough syrup to Aspirin and everything in between there is a potential for negative side-effects. As it pertains to Anavar not only is this steroidal hormone very side-effect friendly, as is with most anabolic steroids side-effects are largely avoidable when responsible use is implored. As abuse or mega dosing often increases risk ones sensitivity to the hormone also plays a large role and this is true with all things in life; some people cant take Tylenol because it makes them sick, other take it every day; some people cant eat eggs or they become deathly ill, while others eat eggs every single day. When we look at the side-effects of anabolic steroids in general the first thing we notice is most are estrogenic in nature and this is due to the conversion of estrogen in the body brought on by the presence of the active hormone. If youre supplementing with Anavar there is good news, Anavar does not possess this trait, meaning, there is no estrogen conversion and such related <strong>side-effects are non-existent</strong>. Why is this important? Because there is no conversion process or what is better known as the aromatase process there is no risk in Gynecomastia, water retention, there are <strong>fewer risk in-terms of blood pressure and cholesterol and to top it off only a mild suppression of natural testosterone production</strong>. As we understand anabolic steroids suppress natural testosterone production, many suppress it to such a strong degree that its non-existent when the hormones are being used. Keep in mind, while Anavar does not suppress testosterone greatly it still suppresses it and if a man were to supplement with Anavar for the purpose of performance enhancement he will necessarily supplement with quite a bit thereby decreasing natural testosterone production quite handedly.
<h3>Anavar and Women:</h3>
The Girl Steroid is this really a true or fair name? Sure, men can supplement with Anavar and do so successfully but when we consider the limited nature of anabolic steroids women can use and how well they tolerate and respond to Anavar then absolutely The Girl Steroid is the perfect name. The majority of anabolic androgenic steroids have <strong>strong virilization effects when taken by women</strong> that can range from deepened vocal chords, body-hair growth and clitoral enlargement to name a few. Obviously these are not welcomed traits as they are in the face of a womans very femininity but with Anavar these traits simply do not exist when responsible use is implored; in-fact, most all women will find the steroid to be side-effect free. As it is so well-tolerated many female athletes around the world supplement with the hormone but unlike men many women have found a very suitable bulking agent in the Anavar hormone; while mild most women simply require a lessened boost if you will to see phenomenal gains. However, it is in the world of competitive physique sports that is perhaps this particular steroids greatest and most welcomed home, as it is not only a favorite but in many cases an outright necessity to the majority ofbodybuilding, figure, fitness and even many bikini competitors.
<h3>Anavar Cycles and Doses:</h3>
While Anavar will never be our primary recommended steroid for most men they can use it successfully and it can be quite useful especially when dieting; however, due to its mild nature most men will require a large amount and as it is one of the more expensive steroids on the market this can prove to be often inefficient. In any case, most men will find <strong>50mg per day</strong> to be the perfect starting point and in most cases this should be viewed as a minimum dosing but the majority of men will reap very little reward until they approach 80mg per day. Keep in mind, Anavar normally comes in 10mg tablets and often $2 per tablet is considered a good deal; as you can see, this can get very expensive. As we have discussed women are far more sensitive to the steroids attributes and therefore require far less; most women will find <strong>10mg per day to be the perfect dose</strong> and often all the Anavar they ever need with <strong>20mg being a good rule of thumb in-terms of maximal dose</strong>. While 20mg can be used safely we do not recommend you start there as while side-effects may indeed be very mild its always best to play it safe; besides, if you can get all you need out of 10mg then upping the dose proves to be pointless and simply a waste. In either case, both men and women, Anavar can be used for far longer than most oral anabolic steroids due to its low liver toxicity rating and further as it does not appear to taper off in benefit as fast as many other oral anabolic steroids. The majority of Anavar users will supplement for 6-8 weeks but longer durations of 12 weeks are not uncommon, especially during female contest preparation time. Keep in mind, the leaner you are the greater the results will be, meaning, they will be far more pronounced; for this reason most women will choose Anavar during the latter half of their diet to reap the greatest reward.
<h2>Effects of Anavar</h2>
Generally mild and relatively safe, the effects of Anavar are highly desired by many performance enhancers for those very reasons. Of course it remains, while generally understood by many the true effects of Anavar are often a mystery to most as most simply do not understand anabolic androgenic steroids in the first place. It is here we will clear up any confusion you may have so as to provide you with the means of proper and efficient supplementation. On that basis we will discuss the effects of Anavar, not in a specific hormonal structure sense, although we will touch on that briefly but more in-terms of practical application; after all, thats really the information you need and desire.
<h3>General Understanding:</h3>
The anabolic steroid Anavar is comprised of the active steroidal hormone Oxandrolone, a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived hormone of a C17-aa nature. Rapidly acting the effects of Anavar begin to manifest themselves very shortly after administration but as so rapidly acting the total duration of activity is approximately 9 hours; a very short half-life. For this reason most men who supplement will need multiple doses throughout the day, although women will normally suffice with one. By its nature the Oxandrolone hormone does not aromatize and as such any lean tissue built due to its use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue. While this remains true its primary role will far more largely revolve around tissue preservation and repair; this shouldnt be all that surprising as the hormone was originally intended for burn victims and those suffering from muscle wasting diseases. As such most men will find this to be a poor bulking agent and will find use more apt to dieting phases; while women will also see this steroid highly beneficial when dieting, as they are more sensitive it can have a larger positive effect during off-season training.
<h3>Practical Effects of Anavar:</h3>
The effects of Anavar will be most pronounced when used as part of the dieting or cutting process. In the grand scheme of action largely we can sum up the effects of Anavar with three words, greater metabolic efficiency. Through proper use the Oxandrolone hormone can provide the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Greater Muscle Tissue Preservation</li>
 	<li>Enhanced Muscular &amp; Cellular Regeneration</li>
 	<li>Increased Rate of Lipolysis</li>
 	<li>Decreased Release of Glucocorticoid Hormones</li>
</ul>
Of course traits such as increased nitrogen retention and protein synthesis will all be in play but the practical effects of Anavar can largely be summed up in the list above. In the end these effects lead to a leaner and harder physique and as most supplement for physique related purposes this can make Oxandrolone a fine choice.
<h3>Dosing &amp; Duration:</h3>
To maximize the effects of Anavar youre going to need the correct dose and time frame of use. Most women will find 10mg per day to be perfect with 6 weeks of continuous use to be more than sufficient. As for men things become a little trickier. As a very mild anabolic steroid and we do mean very mild, most men will need a fairly large dose to reap a reward if they are to truly take advantage of the effects of Anavar. Most men will find 50mg per day to be a solid dose with many going as high as 80mg per day. Generally 6-8 weeks of continuous use at the end of a cutting phase will be optimal. Of course as this is a very expensive steroid and one most men will use as part of a total stack this can get very expensive. In any case, man or woman, the Oxandrolone hormone can be a welcomed addition to a cycle and is worth strong consideration.
<h2>Anavar Side-Effects</h2>
When supplementing with anabolic steroids one of the primary concerns is adverse side-effects and necessarily so; after all, if you fall prey to serious problems this can make the benefits you receive rather pointless. Of course as there are hundreds of various anabolic steroids and there are significant differences with each and every one we cannot simply say steroids carry these side-effects; in actuality we must go even deeper. Each anabolic steroid will carry its own list of possible side-effects and while there will often be strong similarities there can also be a level of uniqueness. Further, it is important to understand possible means possible, not guaranteed and moreover we must consider the total rate of probability. We cannot say if you supplement with XYZ steroid youll suffer from 123 side-effects; there are issues to consider such as total dosing, individual response and even the potency of the steroid at hand. With all of this in mind we want to discuss Anavar side-effects. Oxandrolone is a very popular DHT derived anabolic steroid commonly sold under the trade name Anavar. A mild steroid but one that can be very beneficial, Anavar side-effects are also very mild and it is for this reason the steroid remains so popular. When examining Anavar side-effects we will find this is perhaps one of the friendliest anabolic steroids of all; perhaps the friendliest of all time; in-fact, even women can supplement with this steroid very safely and effectively. Lets take a look and see what we can find.
<h3>Aromatase Anavar Side-Effects:</h3>
Many anabolic steroids aromatize causing a buildup in estrogen throughout the body. This increase in estrogen is often responsible for many of the most common anabolic steroid related problems but in regards to the Oxandrolone hormone there is some very good news. Anavar side-effects of an aromatase nature are non-existent as this steroid will not aromatize at all. As it will not aromatize this makes Gynecomastia and water retention, two commonly feared side-effects impossible when the Oxandrolone hormone is in play. As aromatase will not occur protection that is often needed when other steroids are in play is not needed here; of course if youre supplementing with other steroids with your Anavar this can change things; here we are only concerned with the Oxandrolone hormone.
<h3>Possible Anavar Side-Effects:</h3>
As aromatase cannot occur this factor is moot but there are possible Anavar side-effects we must be aware of in order to protect ourselves. The good news is as a mild steroid most who supplement will have very little concern but as with all things we put into our body there is a possibility. While there is a possibility the probability of adverse Anavar side-effects is very low with responsible use; in-fact, the rate of probability is so low that most men who take high doses will not have any problems. Possible Anavar side-effects include:
<ul>
 	<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
 	<li>High Cholesterol</li>
 	<li>Hair-Loss</li>
 	<li>Acne</li>
</ul>
Almost all who live a healthy lifestyle will never see their blood pressure or cholesterol change, not even slightly. As for hair-loss, only those who are genetically predisposed will carry this risk but as the hormone is so mild the odds will be in their favor. The same can be said of acne; only those who are predisposed to acne will have any problems and as a mild hormone its still a long shot.
<h3>Female Anavar Side-Effects:</h3>
The same Anavar side-effects discussed above are a possibility in women but in the case of the female athlete we must add to the list. The overall concern regarding females and anabolic steroid use is virilization as virilization can destroy a womans femininity. However, Oxandrolone in reasonable and responsible amounts will almost never cause this; in-fact, we can almost guarantee it. While this is true it must be stated; those who take large amounts do increase their risk. Further, there will be those who are simply extra sensitive and even at a low dose problems may arise. If you find you are one of the unlucky few you should discontinue use immediately. If you discontinue use at the very onset of virilization symptoms they will fade away quickly and no damage will be done. It is when the symptoms are ignored that problems will arise.
<h3>The End Game:</h3>
As you can see this is a very mild steroid and while there are some Anavar side-effects worthy of note the list is rather simple and easy to control. Of course it is also important to note that while a mild steroid Oxandrolone will suppress your natural testosterone; for some reason over the years a myth has started stating this isnt so. Rest assured, while a mild steroid and one that does not suppress greatly, natural testosterone production will be suppressed none the less. In the end responsible use will always be our best friend and if you can hold to this we can assure you youll more than likely enjoy your experience.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

<h1>Winstrol</h1>
<h2>(Stanozolol)</h2>
Winstrol is one of the most desired and hyped <strong>anabolic steroids</strong> on earth. Largely thanks to the massive media attention the drug has received over the years but more so due to the idea surrounding Winstrol as a Cutting steroid. Lets be clear, almost any anabolic steroid can be used to Cut or drop body-fat; the use of the words <strong>Cutting Steroids</strong> should only be taken with a grain of salt and that includes when talking about Winstrols.
<h2>Overview of Effects</h2>
Winstrol is an anabolic steroid with very low androgenic qualities yet highly anabolic. Its strengths lie within its ability to promote increases in strength, as well as harden an already lean physique. This hardening effect is what has led Winstrol to be known as a Cutting Steroid in many circles but make no mistake, Winstrol will not magically rip you to shreds; you must possess already low levels of body fat for it to give your body a harder more defined appearance. Yes, absolutely, Winstrol can help you achieve a lower body fat but all anabolic steroids can do this with just as much success. Winstrol is a long standing favorite of the bodybuilding world due to its hardening effects but somebodybuilders swear by it even in their off-season as a means to solidify gains or to increase strength during a cycle, thereby enabling them to push more weight and grow. However, although this is not the most common use of the drug it is also not recommended. Winstrol is one of the most toxic anabolic steroids to the liver and cycles of Winstrol are best run for short durations of six to eight weeks and not during Bulking cycles; save Winstrol for other purposes. Beyond the bodybuilding world <strong>Winstrol</strong> has firmly placed itself on the pedestal of most well-knownanabolics on the planet thanks to its use in professional sports by individuals in just about every professional sport imaginable. Winstrol as we discussed can greatly increase strength and this includes an increase in ones strength of speed. Further, due to its inability to promote massive gains in muscle tissue, it is a drug that can be used in low doses without generating a lot of suspicion. More importantly, Winstrol is only detectable for a very short period of time and is very, very easy to cover up if a drug test is made known to the athlete; these things make Winstrol a top choice for many professional athletes and for obvious reasons. It should be noted, the <strong>drug Winstrol</strong> and the <strong>drug Stanozolol</strong> are one in the same. <strong>Stanozolol is the official drug name</strong>. Many anabolic steroids carry a name based on the name of their original producer, for example the drug commonly known as Dianabol is specifically and more correctly known as Methandrostenolone; the same concepts applies here with Stanozolol or as you know it, Winstrol or Winstrol Depot.
<h2>Effects of Winstrol</h2>
Like all anabolic steroidal hormones the effects of Winstrol can be broken down into two distinct categories; the positive effects and adverse effects. By its nature, as we will see the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a stronger physique; such a trait can be perfect for an athlete looking for more strength and speed. Further, the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a better looking physique making it an excellent contest prep bodybuilding steroid and one for gym rats desiring a similar looking physique. Of course this steroid is not without fault as the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Such effects can range from common DHT related, to liver toxicity and of course natural testosterone suppression. Of course the hormone can be used safely and while some side-effects are indeed very genetically based revolving around individual response, most who supplement responsibly will have very few if any serious problems. Let’s take a look at the effects of Winstrol and discover how we can best maximize the effects within this DHT based steroid.
<h3>The Positive Effects of Winstrol:</h3>
Without question the primary positive effects of Winstrol revolve around strength and overall athletic performance; in-fact, it is athletic performance that has made this steroid so popular. This increase in strength can be translated into direct physical power, speed and simply a better performing athlete. No, the hormone will not create non-existing talent; it will simply enhance the talents already in place. Like all anabolic steroids the effects of Winstrol do not create an athlete, they simply enhance already existing athletic talent. Beyond performance athletics this steroid has a welcomed home in the physique inspired world as the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote this end. While a very poor mass building steroid the effects of Winstrol in this regard largely surround dieting phases. Winstrol is very apt for preserving lean tissue and strength when calories are restricted; ask any bodybuilder and he’ll assure you this is a more than welcomed trait. Further, by its nature the effects of Winstrol can greatly promote a harder and more vascular look; key components to the physique game. Of course it must be noted this hormone will not make a fat physique ripped. To enjoy these physique enhancing qualities the athlete will need to be fairly lean to begin with if they are going to show; contrary to popular culture belief anabolic steroids are not magical.
<h3>The Adverse Effects of Winstrol:</h3>
Like all anabolic steroids the adverse effects of Winstrol are very real. Of course simply stating adverse reactions may occur is not enough, factors such as individual response, total dosing and time of use must be taken into consideration. For example, the higher the dose and the longer we supplement the greater potential there is for negative effects; this may sound obvious and perhaps over simplistic but these are factors many choose to ignore. What are the possible adverse effects of Winstrol use? A few of these are guaranteed, some are genetically dependent and one is very individual based on behavior. The effects of Winstrol in this category include:
<ul>
 	<li>Cholesterol Issues: Winstrol can lower your HDL and increase your LDL. Those who already have cholesterol issues should avoid this steroid. Those who do not, who supplement responsibly and live a lifestyle that promotes healthy cholesterol levels will not have any problems.</li>
 	<li>Liver Toxicity: As a C17-aa anabolic steroid the effects of Winstrol include liver toxicity. This occurs due to the structural change associated with all C17-aa steroids. While unfortunate this structural change is necessary for the hormone to survive ingestion and administration. By this nature liver enzyme levels will increase when the hormone is used. However, if we are responsible in our supplementation, as the liver rejuvenates quickly enzyme levels will return to normal shortly after use is discontinued leaving no permanent damage. It is however highly advised you avoid heavy alcohol consumption when this hormone is in play.</li>
 	<li>Hair-Loss: As a DHT based anabolic steroid those predisposed to hair-loss may find they lose some hair with Winstrol supplementation. Those who are not predisposed will not lose the first hair on their head. Put simply, if you lose any hair you were going to lose it anyway; the Winstrol simply sped it up.</li>
 	<li>Acne: Another DHT based effect and again it will be of concern to those genetically predisposed. The majority of people will have no problem but if you are acne sensitive this steroid may cause breakouts. For this reason it is important you keep your skin very clean and always ensure your product is of a clean and pure nature.</li>
 	<li>Testosterone Suppression: For some reason many performance enhancers believe the effects of Winstrol do not include testosterone suppression; we assure you it does. For this reason you are highly encouraged to seek out remedy with exogenous testosterone use being your best bet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winstrol Cycle</h2>
A Winstrol cycle is one of the most common anabolic steroid cycles of all. Somewhat mild in nature when compared to many other anabolic steroids this is a steroid well-suited for strengthening athletes in all sports and a very good bodybuilding contest prep hormone. While the basic Winstrol cycle has been part of sports for a very long time it reached new levels of popularity during the 1988 Summer Olympics when Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, the hormone that makes Winstrol. While not the best bulking steroid for men a Winstrol cycle can be successfully run by female athletes in both bulking and dieting phases and as such is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be used safely by women. Regardless of sex or specific purpose of use a Winstrol cycle can provide fantastic gains to help you achieve your desired end. Let’s delve in and see what we can find.
<h3>Injectable &amp; Tablet Forms:</h3>
A solid Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) based anabolic hormone, Stanozolol can be commonly found in both injectable and tablet form. Regardless of the form you have the same Stanozolol hormone and your Winstrol cycle will be just as effective with either form. It is true that the injectable form is slightly more potent and on this basis some will always choose this form for their Winstrol cycle. Further, as a very liver toxic steroid due to its C17-aa nature many assume the injectable is a safer option. Let’s be clear, while slightly more potent in its injectable form the difference is negligible at best. As for liver toxicity, the injectable form of Stanozolol is also of a C17-aa nature just like the tablet; both forms are highly liver toxic. When you’re planning your Winstrol cycle the only thing that really matters is ensuring your product is of a high quality nature; beyond this the form does not matter.
<h3>Winstrol Cycle for Women:</h3>
While anabolic steroid use can be very dangerous for women due to virilization effects, Winstrol remains one of the few choices females have at their disposal. Virilization symptoms appear to be much lower when supplementation is of a responsible nature but we must stress while the odds are in your favor virilization may still occur. If such symptoms begin to show the athlete should discontinue use immediately before they set in permanently. Most women will find a Winstrol cycle of 6 weeks in length to be sufficient at a dosing of 10mg every other day to every day depending on the athlete, desired end and response to the hormone. Some women may be able to tolerate as much as a 20mg dose but they should be forewarned that virilization will become a stronger reality. While a Winstrol cycle can be a solid option for the female athlete Anavar still remains our primary choice for female athletes.
<h3>Winstrol Cycle for Men:</h3>
For the male Winstrol cycle, regardless of purpose of use 6-8 weeks of total use will normally suffice. For athletes looking for a boost in performance a dosing of 50mg every other day will in most all cases provide what they are looking for. Of course some will want more and if more is needed and this will be common in competitive bodybuilding circles or simply those looking for a similar physique a dose of 50mg every day can provide this end. As for doses of a higher nature, 100mg per day is the most Stanozolol any man will ever want to take and such a dose can only be recommended for very short periods of time. Such a case might be for a competitive bodybuilder right before his competition, say the last 10-14 days leading up to the show. In all cases most men will find this to be a poor mass building steroid as the very nature of Stanozolol will not readily promote this end. It can have bulking benefits due to its ability to increase synergy between other anabolic steroids but due to it being so toxic to the liver use should be limited to specific and most beneficial times. If one will save his Winstrol cycle for such phases of use he will most certainly find the hormone to be highly beneficial.
<h2>Winstrol Pills</h2>
Winstrol pills are one of the most common forms of the anabolic steroid hormone Stanozolol if for no other reason than their ease of use. While available in an injectable solution as well, in either case pill or injectable you have the same Stanozolol hormone at hand. While ease of use may make Winstrol pills more popular than the injectable form in many circles what truly makes this one of the most popular steroids of all time is simply by the way it functions. The Stanozolol hormone is not well-suited for building mass, in-fact, it won’t do much at all in this regard but the traits and benefits it will bring to the table are worth their weight in gold to most any performance enhancer.
<h3>Winstrol Pills &amp; the Injectable Myth:</h3>
It’s commonly understood that as a C17-aa anabolic steroid Winstrol pills are very toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is the truth. However, it is commonly believed that the injectable form commonly known as Winstrol Depot is not toxic to the liver; if this is something you’ve been told it is a myth. The injectable form is also of a C17-aa nature, in-fact, you can actually administer the injectable form orally simply by drinking it. In both cases, Winstrol pills or Winstrol Depot you have the same Stanozolol hormone in a C17-aa form by-which is necessary for the hormones survival in the body. As such the total time of use should be limited and dosing should always be of a responsible level. If you can hold to this practice any effect the hormone has on your liver enzymes will not be of a permanent nature as the liver has amazing rejuvenating qualities.
<h3>Winstrol Pills Dosing:</h3>
Winstrol pills are most commonly found in 50mg and 10mg tablets. Regardless of the pills potency the same Stanozolol hormone is in each pill. Generally 10mg tablets will be perfect for female users as the average female dosing is 10mg per day. Some females may be able to tolerate 20mg per day for short periods of time but such a dosing can greatly increase the probability of virilization symptoms. Conversely most men will find 50mg Winstrol pills to be perfect for their needs as the average male Stanozolol dose is 50mg per day. If 50mg Winstrol pills are not available simply take the number of 10mg pills needed to meet your desired dose.
<h3>Optimal Use:</h3>
As a very poor bulking agent Winstrol pills will be best served when used in cutting cycles. During cutting cycles where calories are restricted the Stanozolol hormone will greatly promote tissue preservation and rejuvenation. Further, as a steroid apt towards strength, during a diet strength will be greatly preserved. Moreover, in the name of conditioning Winstrol pills will greatly promote a leaner and harder physique making this one of the more popular bodybuilding contest prep steroids. While cutting cycles are a fantastic use, Winstrol pills remain very popular in athletic circles for the purpose of simply enhancing overall athletic performance. Again, as increasing strength is this steroids greatest attribute and since strength is the end all be all for athletes this can be a fine choice. Further, as mass will not be built to a large degree and many athletes see mass as a hindrance in-terms of its effects on performance as well as the prying eyes it can invite this again makes Winstrol pills a fine choice.
<h2>Winstrol Results</h2>
You hear talk regarding anabolic steroids all the time but often it is in a very general sense. When most people talk about anabolic steroids visions of monstrous behemoths come to mind but what many fail to realize is that not all steroids meet this end. There are steroids that are far more suited towards building lean mass than others, there are steroids that will do more for strength and very little for mass; in the end, how big you get really boils down to how big you eat. For example, let’s examine the anabolic steroid Stanozolol commonly referred to by its most popular trade nameWinstrol. For those who supplement with this powerful DHT derived steroid Winstrol results while powerful will not translate into massive gains in size. Even in massive doses, which no one would recommend as such would be dangerous and pretty much a waste, Winstrol results will still not lead to the behemoth mentioned a few moments ago. For many this may be surprising; after all, most do not understand anabolic steroids but the truth is simple, each anabolic steroid is a little unique.
<h3>Athletic Winstrol Results:</h3>
The Stanozolol hormone has been very popular in the world of competitive sports for decades; we’re talking about everything from football to baseball and even track and field; in-fact, it is track and field that gave this steroid world renowned popularity. The reason is simple; Winstrol results in increased strength and increased speed in the athlete. This not only enables the athlete to train harder but garners him the ability to perform his desired sport at the highest level. To put it simply, while it may sound very simplistic it’s the easiest way to look at it; Winstrol results in a more effective and efficient athlete. No, it will not make a terrible athlete a great one; this is something many fail to understand about anabolic androgenic steroids in general; it will however allow and enable the athlete to perform at his or her peak potential of which cannot be obtained without.
<h3>Primary Winstrol Results:</h3>
When supplementing with this steroid the primary Winstrol results will be that of an increase in strength. Such an increase can be translated into direct physical power, the ability to move more weight and it can also be translated into more speed producing a faster athlete. As this is the primary trait it remains Stanozolol is one of the most popular anabolic steroids among performance athletes; so much so it finds its way into most any sport and in amounts that would probably blow your mind. It is true, while supplemental use of Winstrol results in very little mass increase some lean tissue may be gained but as this steroid does not aromatize each and every ounce gained will be that of pure lean muscle mass. With strength still being the primary trait dieting athletes, especially those of a physique nature may find this trait to be very beneficial. When we diet our strength generally declines as calories are restricted. When you diet you’re taking in fewer calories than you need to maintain your weight and often strength pays the price. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in such strength being greatly preserved as the hormone will aid in preserving lean muscle tissue. Of course the leaner we get the harder this will become but you can guarantee you’ll hold onto a lot more strength with this hormone in play than if not.
<h3>Secondary Winstrol Results:</h3>
In some ways lean tissue preservation could be placed in this category as strength is the primary trait but it also fits here. As we hold onto more lean tissue when dieting our metabolism is enhanced and as Winstrol results in a faster metabolism by the manner in-which the hormone performs in the body our metabolism is enhanced all the more. You may be thinking we’re putting too much emphasis on metabolism but for those who understand how difficult burning body-fat can be while trying to maintain lean tissue these people understand how invaluable metabolic related traits can be. Other secondary Winstrol results also fall into the dieting field. Supplemental use of Winstrol results in a harder and more defined physique and one that is more vascular to boot. This makes the Stanozolol hormone very popular in competitive bodybuilding circles as a lean, hard and vascular physique is the name of the game. We must stress and would be remised to leave this out; Winstrol will not magically turn a fat physique into a granite statue, you must already be somewhat lean to display these physique related traits. However, while that is true, if you are lean you will find Winstrol results in a much more impressive physique than a physique that is absent the hormone.
<h2>Winstrol Side-Effects</h2>
Moderately mild in nature, the hormone Stanozolol is one of the more popular anabolic steroidsamong avid performance enhancers; you know it best as Winstrol. Generally best served used in cutting cycles or as a direct athletic performance enhancer due to its ability to increases strength, while moderately mild Winstrol side-effects are very real indeed. While adverse Winstrol side-effects may occur they are by no means guaranteed. There are many factors that must be considered and if responsible use is implored you will find this is one of the few anabolic steroids that can be safely used by most any athlete. An anabolic steroid of the DHT class Stanozolol will not aromatize at all making common steroidal problems such as Gynecomastia and water retention of no concern; with that in mind, let’s take a look at the possible Winstrol side-effects and discover what we need to know.
<h3>Severe Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3>
Of all the possible adverse Winstrol side-effects issues surrounding cholesterol will prove to be the most serious of all. As you understand cholesterol is generally broken down into two categories, LDL, the bad cholesterol and HDL, the good cholesterol your body needs. The Stanozolol hormone can have a negative effect on both cholesterol readings and those who are predisposed to cholesterol issues or who already suffer from a poor condition should avoid this steroid like the plague. To combat these possible cholesterol issues we must keep our total dosing at a responsible level and limit the time of use to a responsible time frame. Further, following a diet that is cholesterol friendly will do more for you than anything else; those who fail to do so even when their Stanozolol use is of a responsible nature may find they fall prey to problems.
<h3>Liver Related Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3>
It is generally commonly understood that the Stanozolol hormone is of a strong hepatic nature; simply put, of all the adverse Winstrol side-effects it remains liver toxicity is one of the most common. By its very existence the Stanozolol hormone belongs to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroidal hormones. This is classification is defined by a structural alteration to the hormone that allows it to survive ingestion; without such a structural change the hormone would be destroyed before any benefit could take place. While this structural change allows the hormone to survive its first pass through the liver it also makes it very toxic; it is a tradeoff and one that is unavoidable. It is a common misconception held by many performance enhancers that only the oral form of this hormone is hepatic in nature; this is an outright lie. Just as the oral form is C17-aa so is the injectable; in that there is no difference. When we supplement with this steroid our liver enzyme readings will go up; how much will be determined by total dosing and total time of use but they will go up none the less. For this reason, again, we must maintain a level of responsible use. For those who supplement in a responsible fashion there is some very good news. The liver has amazing rejuvenating capabilities and once use is discontinued, assuming the individual has been responsible liver enzyme levels will normalize and no permanent damage will be done. It should also be noted, during the course of use heavy alcohol consumption should be avoided; in-fact, laying off alcohol completely is probably not a bad idea.
<h3>The Myth &amp; the Truth:</h3>
One of the reasons Stanozolol remains so popular is because many believe Winstrol side-effects do not include testosterone suppression; how this myth started is unclear but it is a myth just the same. When we supplement with anabolic androgenic steroids our natural testosterone production will be suppressed. Certain steroids will have a stronger effect in this regard but suppression will occur just the same. If you supplement with Winstrol your levels will fall and this is not only unhealthy but can be detrimental to your cause. For this reason some form of precaution is advised with exogenous testosterone use being your absolute best bet.
<h3>DHT Based Winstrol Side-Effects:</h3>
As a DHT based anabolic hormone both hair-loss and acne can be a very real possibility; in-fact, these may be the most common Winstrol side-effects of all in-terms of visual effects. Assuring your product is clean and of a pure nature will greatly protect you from acne, as will keeping your skin extra clean; however, those who are genetically sensitive to acne may still have a problem. Those who are not genetically sensitive and who supplement with a pure product will in most all cases be fine. As for hair-loss, it is true, this is one of the primary Winstrol side-effects but it is not as cut and dry as you might think. Like acne, hair-loss is very genetically dependent. Those who are predisposed to male-pattern baldness run the greatest risk; men who are not should not lose the first hair on their head. If you are genetically predisposed to hair-loss, simply put you were going to lose some of your hair to begin with; the Stanozolol hormone simply caused this to occur sooner than it would have otherwise.
<h2>Winstrol Stacking</h2>
Winstrol stacking is very popular among many performance athletes as the Stanozolol hormone by-which it is comprised, is highly beneficial. In most cases Winstrol stacking will be reserved for cuttingcycles as this compound has very little use when it comes to trying to pack on size. Of course beyond cutting cycles many athletes simply use the hormone to enhance overall athletic performance; in-fact, this is one of its most common uses. However, it remains cutting cycles will be the most common point of use for Winstrol stacking as the majority of performance enhancers are physique based inspired; we’re not simply talking about bodybuilders but gym rats as well and they are the majority. We have broken down some Winstrol stacking examples for your benefit. We have provided you examples for both beginner and advanced use as well as male and female use. That is correct, Stanozolol is one of the very few anabolic steroids that can be used by women and as such Winstrol stacking is very popular among female athletes in a host of arenas. While all of this remains true our examples will be somewhat of a general nature as we cannot give you an example for each and every individual to meet their specific needs; however, for the brunt of you these Winstrol stacking plans will meet your needs to a tee.
<h3>Female Winstrol Stacking:</h3>
While females can absolutely supplement with the Stanozolol hormone safely precaution must be applied. The general concern regarding anabolic steroids and females is virilization and fortunately Winstrol, while carrying a possibility will generally do so mildly. If a female supplements responsibly in most cases she will be fine but as we are all unique individuals, individual response will play a role. There will be some women who cannot touch this steroid even at a low dose and if problems begin to occur, you are urged to discontinue use. If you discontinue the moment problems arise they will dissipate and you will be fine. It is when these problems are ignored that they set in permanently. For most women 10mg every other day to even every day in some cases will be all the Stanozolol they need. However, some women will be able to tolerate as much as 20mg per day but this should only be tried by very experienced, very advanced and only in athletes who are in desperate need. Most women will never have a need to go above 10mg per day. We have provided two Winstrol stacking examples; a beginner to Stanozolol use and one who is more advanced with anabolic steroid cycling:
<ol>
 	<li>Female Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/eod WK 7-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li>
 	<li>Female Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-4 Winstrol 10mg/ed WK 3-8 Primobolan Depot 100mg/wk WK 5-12 Anavar 10mg/ed WK 10-12 Nolvadex 10mg/ed (for physique competitors)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Male Winstrol Stacking:</h3>
For the male athlete his Stanozolol use will fall in a bit of a different form; generally we will see use of this hormone at the back half of a cycle rather than early on in female use. Further, as it is a poor bulking choice for men, although it can benefit a woman during this time, for a man it will always be cutting cycle related. In many cases it is a bit inaccurate to label a particular steroid a bulker or a cutter but when it comes to male Stanozolol use we can make an exception; for male Stanozolol use this is a cutting steroid. The majority of men will find 50mg every day to be the perfect dosing for all their Winstrol stacking needs. Regardless of experience this will be our standard dose. Of course those who are looking for a slight anabolic bump to aid in athletic performance may only need this dose every other day and some may only need 25mg every other day; even so it remains 50mg every day will be our gold standard. Again, we have provided you two examples of Winstrol stacking, one for a beginner and one for an advanced anabolic steroid user:
<ol>
 	<li>Male Beginner Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 400mg/wk WK 7-12 Winstrol 50mg/ed WK 1-12 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 400mg-500mg/wk</li>
 	<li>Male Advanced Winstrol Stacking: WK 1-8 Equipoise 200mg/eod WK 1-8 Testosterone-Enanthate or Cypionate 200mg-250mg/eod WK 9-16 Testosterone-Propionate 200mg/eod WK 9-16 Trenbolone-Acetate 100mg/eod</li>
</ol>
*Note: Physique competitors may find bumping the Winstrol up to 100mg/ed the last 10-14 days to be beneficial but this would be the longest period and only reason for such use. Competitors may also find increasing the Trenbolone use to every day the last 10-14 days to be highly beneficial as well. **Note: Male Winstrol stacking examples have not included possible SERM’s, AI’s, Growth Hormone, or fat-burning agents such as Clenbuterol and Cytomel (T3) that may be highly beneficial as well; we have only focused on the steroidal part of the plan.

<h2>Winstrol Tablets</h2>
Winstrol tablets are a popular form of the anabolic steroid known as Stanozolol; a potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived steroid of immense popularity. Very popular among performance athletes in almost all sports its popularity is even larger among the millions upon millions of avid gym rats the world over. Of course you might think that’s an overstatement, hardly; in the U.S. alone over six-million American adults supplement with anabolic steroids for the purpose of performance enhancement and as Winstrol tablets are of a mild and generally of a tolerable nature you better believe millions are supplementing with them. To give you some understanding as to why so many supplement let’s take a look at Winstrol tablets and see what we can unveil.
<h3>Winstrol Tablets:</h3>
A DHT based anabolic steroid, Winstrol tablets belong to the C17-aa class of anabolic steroids as well. The C17-aa classification refers to a structural change of the hormone at the 17th carbon position that is necessary to allow the hormones survival; without this structural change the hormone would be destroyed by the liver. While necessary this structural change makes C17-aa steroids rather liver toxic; in the case of Winstrol tablets we have one of the most toxic of all. However do not let your heart be troubled yet; remember, even Tylenol is toxic to the liver and we must think in relative, realistic and responsible terms. The truth is simple; the liver possess amazing rejuvenation abilities and with responsible use, although liver enzyme levels will increase during use they will return to normal very quickly once use is discontinued; again, assuming use is of a responsible nature. If that’s not enough to ease your mind regular alcohol consumption of a heavy nature is far more toxic to the liver than Winstrol tablets and it’s safe to say a lot of you don’t think twice about it. Beyond its DHT and C17-aa nature Winstrol tablets carry an active half-life of approximately 9 hours making daily administration necessary if we are to maintain stable levels of the Stanozolol hormone. When we do the hormone will perform in a highly anabolic manner with very low androgenic activity. By its function Winstrol tablets greatly increase nitrogen retention in the muscles, increase protein synthesis and dramatically lower SHBG allowing more free-testosterone to be used by the body.
<h3>When to Supplement with Winstrol Tablets:</h3>
By its nature Winstrol tablets are not powerful mass builders; in-fact, they will do very little to promote significant growth. However, some growth can be obtained, largely due to the lower SHBG factor and by the manner in-which Stanozolol creates synergy with other anabolic steroids being used. Further, as this steroid does not aromatize at all any weight gained due to use will be that of pure lean muscle tissue; it simply won’t be much and as it is so toxic to the liver use is best served for other purposes as other options are more efficient for bulking. Without question the two best times to supplement with Winstrol tablets is during a cutting cycle or a cycle designed to enhance overall athletic performance. To begin, Winstrol tablets will promote an increase in strength, as an athlete that is the name of the game; stronger and faster. It will not take a lot of this hormone to achieve this; most men will find doses of 25mg-50mg every other day to be all they need with most women only needing 10mg every other day. While enhancing athletic performance is a good use for this steroid it remains cutting cycles are the most common point of use as the majority of performance enhancers are enhancing simply to build a better physique. During a cutting cycle one will necessarily be consuming a restricted amount of calories in-order to burn fat. As calories are restricted losses of lean tissue and strength are sure to occur. Through supplemental use of the Stanozolol hormone we are able to preserve a great deal of our lean tissue and strength, thereby further enhancing our overall metabolic rate and burning even more fat. Moreover, by the manner in-which the hormone exist, when lean enough we will display a much harder and well-defined physique and for a physique minded individual there is not much more you can ask for. For this purpose most men will find a dose of 50mg every day to be more than sufficient with most women again only needing 10mg every other day, with daily doses being tolerated well in some specific cases.
<h3>The End Game:</h3>
Whatever your purpose of use may be you’ll find Winstrol tablets to meet your needs and effectively so. Generally you’ll find the steroid to come in both 10mg and 50mg forms but you’ll also commonly find it available in a water base injectable solution known as Winstrol Depot. If you find the Deport version available to you nothing changes regarding what we have discussed here; it is the same DHT based Stanozolol hormone, it performs identically to Winstrol tablets and like the tablets is also a C17-aa anabolic steroid. In either case and for any purpose it is important to remember responsible use will always be your best friend.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">10 mg/tab.

<h4>Pharmaceutical Name: clenbuterol hydrochloride</h4>
<h4>Chemical Structure: (RS)-1-(4-amino-3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-(tert butylamino)ethanol</h4>
<h4>Effective Dose: 40-160 mcg/day</h4>
Clenbuterol is a widely used bronchodilator in many parts of the world. The drug is most often prepared in 20 mcg tablets, but it is also available in syrup and injectable form. Clenbuterol belongs to a broad group of drugs knows as sympathomimetics. These drugs affect that sympathetic nervous system in a wide number of ways, largely mediated by the distribution of adrenoceptors. There are actually nine different types of these receptors in the body, which are classified as either alpha or beta and further subcategorized by type number. Depending on the specific affinities of these agents for the various receptors, they can potentially be used in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular shock, arrhythmias, migraine headaches and anaphylactic shock. The drug clenbuterol is specifically a selective beta-2 sympathomimetic, primarily affecting only one of the three subsets of beta-receptors. Of particular interest is the fact that this drug has little beta-1 stimulating activity. Since beta-1 receptors are closely tied to the cardiac effects of these agents, this allows clenbuterol to reduce reversible airway obstruction (and effect of beta-2 stimulation) with much less cardiovascular side effects compared to nonselective beta agonists. Clinical studies with this drug show it is extremely effective as a bronchodilator, with a low level of user complaints and high patient compliance. Clenbuterol also exhibits an extremely long half-life in the body, which is measured to be approximately 34 hours long. This makes steady blood levels easy to achieve, requiring only a single or twice daily dosing schedule at most. This of course makes it much easier for the patient to use, and may tie in to its high compliance rate. To spite that clenbuterol is available in a wide number of other countries however; this compound has never been approved for use in the United States. The fact that there are a number of similar, effective asthma medications already available in this country may have something to do with this, as a prospective drug firm would likely not find it a profitable enough product to warrant undergoing the expense of the FDA approval process. Regardless, foreign clenbuterol preparations are widely available on the U.S. black market. In animal studies clenbuterol is shown to exhibit anabolic activity, obviously an attractive trait to the athlete This compound is additionally a known thermogenic, with beta-2 agonists like clenbuterol shown to directly stimulate fat cells and accelerate the breakdown of triglycerides to form free fatty acids. Its efficacy in this area makes clenbuterol a very attractive, and today almost mandatory, pre-contest drug. Those interested in this drug are most often hoping it will impart a little of both benefits, promoting the loss of body fat while imparting strength and muscle mass increases. But as was well pointed out by a review published in the August 1995 issue of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, the possible anabolic activities in humans are very questionable, and based only on animal data using much larger doses than would be required for bronchodilation . With such reports there has been a lot of debate lately as to whether or not clenbuterol is really anabolic at all. Some seem to swear by the fact that it builds muscle regardless, firmly sticking by ""clen"" as a great off-season or adjunct anabolic. To others such reports are confirmation that athletes have wasted valuable time and money on drugs that do not work as they are intended to by the user. This debate continues today, with many still using clenbuterol as a potential anabolic. With this in mind athletes will tailor their dosage and cycling of this product individually depending on which of the two ""possible"" results are more desired, and how much side effects are to be tolerated. The possible side effects of clenbuterol include those of other CNS stimulants, and include such occurrences as shaky hands, insomnia, sweating, increased blood pressure and nausea. These side effects will generally subside after a week or so of use however, once the user becomes accustomed to the drug. One would typically start a cycle by gradually increasing the dosage each day until a desired range is established. This process will minimize the unwanted side effects seen from the drug; which otherwise might be dramatic if a large dose is administered from the onset. Men generally end up in the range of 2-8 tablets per day, although some people do claim to tolerate even higher dosages. Women get by on less, generally 2-4 tablets daily. Very quickly, the drug will elevate the body temperature. The rise is not usually dramatic, perhaps a half of a degree or so, sometimes a little more. This elevation is due to your body burning excess energy (largely from fat) and is usually not uncomfortable. Now that it is working, the number of consecutive days clenbuterol can be used is believed to be dependent on the goal of the individual. To be clear, the athletic benefits of this drug will only last for a limited time and then diminish, largely due to beta-receptor down regulation. When using it for fat loss, the primary effect of the drug, it seems to work well for approximately 4-6 weeks. During this period, users will want to constantly monitor their body temperature. We are assured clenbuterol is working by the temperature elevation. Once the temperature drops back to normal, clenbuterol is no longer exhibiting a thermogenic effect. At this point increasing the dosage would not be very effective, and a break for at least a few weeks should be taken before it is used again effectively. If one is looking for strength gains, clenbuterol appears to be effective for a much shorter period of time, around 3-4 weeks. This may be due to an absence of real anabolic effect, with the strength gain seen with clenbuterol possibly due only to the stimulant properties of the drug (similar to the strength boost seen by ephedrine users). Again however, this is still debated. Many competitors also find the fat burning effect of clenbuterol can be further enhanced by additional substances. When combined with thyroid hormones, specifically the powerful Cytomel, the thermogenic effect can become extremely dramatic. This can be to a point that the athlete could shred exceptional amounts of extra fat during contest preparations, without a dramatic restriction in calories. Such a mix can be further used during a steroid cycle, eliciting a much harder look from the anabolics. These cutting agents can often greatly inhibit extra fat storage during the cycle, even when using strong aromatizing androgens. A clenbuterol/thyroid mix is also common when using growth hormone, further enhancing the thermogenic and anabolic effect of this therapy.","<pre id=""product_reference""><label>Reference:</label> <span class=""editable"">0,04 mg/tab.

<h2><strong>What is sibutramine?</strong></h2>
Sibutramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010. Sibutramine affects chemicals in the brain that affect weight maintenance. Sibutramine is used together with diet and exercise to treat obesity that may be related to diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. Sibutramine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.
<h2><strong>What is the most important information I should know about sibutramine?</strong></h2>
Sibutramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010. Do not use sibutramine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. Serious, life threatening side effects can occur if you use sibutramine before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body.

<h4>Pharmaceutical Name: Oxymetholone</h4>

<h4>Molecular weight of base: 332.482</h4>
&nbsp;
<h1>Oxymetholone</h1>
<strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is a very powerful anabolic androgenic steroid of immense capabilities. Generally abulking steroid, as size promotion is its primary purpose it does possess secondary characteristics well-suited for cutting as well but only in very specific cases and for the average man this type of use will never be implored. As a powerful steroid most will find <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is best used during a bulking cycle at the front end as a kick start to the overall cycle. The most common practice is a 4-6 week run of <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> at a dosing of 50mg per day and for many this will be all the<strong>Oxymetholone</strong> they will ever need. However, for those who want a little more and these individuals always exist, 100g per day for the same time frame can be successfully administered but there are some important notes. It is important to understand how your body reacts to this steroid before you ever begin a 100mg dose; further, understand the possibility of negative side-effects increase dramatically when the dosing is increased. While 100mg a day will prove to be the maximum dosage that can be safely used, assuming the individual knows what they’re doing, beyond 100mg will often prove to be a waste as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong>has been shown to possess a fast diminishing rate when you go past the 100g mark. This simply means doses of 150mg or 200mg and beyond will not produce results greater than 100mg or at least at any noteworthy affect. The same can also be said of total duration; past the 6 week mark the benefits of <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>supplementation will begin to largely fade. While an individual may indeed pack on as much as 20-30lbs with the steroid the first 4-6 weeks such massive increases will not occur past the 6 week mark. As is with all anabolic steroids <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> does carry with it the possibility of negative adverse side-effects and with this steroid they can be very severe; especially when responsible use is thrown to the wind. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>is one of the most hepatic oral steroids on the market; as a 17-aa steroid it is very toxic to the liver but while this is the case with all 17-aa steroids it is more so here. Granted, with responsible use liver damage will often be reversed when use is discontinued but this is assuming responsible sue was implored. Further, as it is well-known for, <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can greatly cause a massive buildup in water retention, so much so that for many the effect can be unbearable. For this reason the use of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is highly advised. Further, the use of an AI will aid in the prevention of Gynecomastia as well, another possible side-effect due to use. It is important to note, regarding water retention more often than not its unbearable nature is brought on by excess carbohydrate consumption. Excess carbohydrates will cause bloat, <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> will cause bloat; couple the two factors together and you often have a mess. Learn to control your eating and this problem can be largely avoided when responsible use is followed. As is easy to see, by its very nature <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> serves the primary role of increasing size, however, many competitive bodybuilders supplement with the steroid at the end of a contest prep cycle in order to fill out more efficiently. One must have a full understanding of the steroid to pull off such use without excess water retention being a problem but as the steroids effect on carbohydrate consumption is so pronounced it can have a positive effect when used properly for this purpose. Regardless of your purpose for use it is very important you ensure you are healthy enough for use to begin with. <strong>Oxymetholone </strong>can severely increase blood pressure and if your blood pressure is already high you cannot use this steroid and if you are predisposed to such a condition you are highly advised to stay away. As with most anabolic steroids supplemental testosterone is very important for the male users as <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> will suppress natural testosterone production. For the female this is a steroid we cannot recommend as virilization can be very problematic when supplemental <strong>Oxymetholone</strong> is part of the female athlete’s plans.
<h1>Anadrol</h1>
<h2>(Oxymetholone)</h2>
We have so many anabolic steroids to choose from; some strong, some a little weaker and anabolicsteroids that serve every purpose imaginable but there is none more potent than that of <strong>Anadrol</strong>, was first developed in the 1960s by Syntex Pharmaceuticals as <strong>oxymetholone</strong> with means to treat muscle wasting diseases, osteoporosis and anemia. As should come as no surprise, being as this drug was developed to treat muscle wasting diseases it would soon find its way into the performance enhancing world, as is common. Anadrol is one of the most powerful anabolic steroids on the planet; as an <strong>oral steroid</strong> there is no stronger. As powerful as Anadrol is it is also one of the most problematic in terms of unwanted side-effects. As with all anabolic steroids there is always a risk to reward ratio and makes no exception.
<h2>Why Anadrol?</h2>
Anadrol greatly increases protein synthesis, a key element in gaining muscle mass; further attributes include its ability to dramatically increase red-blood cell counts in the individual; this is the reason it was developed in the fight against anemia. Anadrol also belongs to a class of steroids that can greatly increase water retention; please make a note of the word Can this is not the same as Will. Although <strong>Anadrol</strong> can greatly increase the amount of water youre holding in your body what many athletes fail to understand is that ones diet greatly affects the amount of water that is held. Many competitive bodybuilders use Anadrol as part of their contest preparations in order to give them a fuller look at the end and if you know anything about bodybuilding it is that water is the enemy when youre on stage. Some individuals will be more sensitive to water retention while using Anadrol some not but either way the punch this anabolic steroid packs is unlike any other. Most Anadrol users will use the drug as part of a stack in conjunction with other anabolic <strong>steroids</strong>. The most common administration of Anadrol is at the beginning of an anabolic steroid cycle the first four to six weeks. <em>Anadrol</em> is one of the more toxic oral <strong>steroids</strong> on the market and use much longer than six weeks is not recommended. However, most Anadrol users will only see substantial gains from the drug the first four to six weeks, so any longer is usually a waste. It is not uncommon for Anadrol users to gain as much as seven to ten pounds per week the first two weeks of use; generally the gains will slow down as the weeks continue. It cannot be stressed enough; a dramatic increase in weight such as this will not occur if one is not eating to fuel such a gain. Yes, weight will still be gained but it is largely dependent on the number of calories coming in.
<h2>Side Effects of Anadrol</h2>
Other common side-effects of Anadrol use include but are not limited to:
<ul>
 	<li>Gynecomastia</li>
 	<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
 	<li>Acne</li>
 	<li>Bloating</li>
</ul>
Although these side-effects can be very nasty, they can also be avoidable. When using <strong>Anadrol</strong> it is highly recommended you use a good aromatase inhibitor such as Anastrozole (Arimidex) to ward of Gynecomastia. Issues such as bloating can usually be eliminated with careful diet planning, however, Anadrol is such a powerful drug sometimes water retention can settle in the lower back region and cause a very uncomfortable feeling. As for Acne, as it is with all anabolic <strong>steroids</strong> and is with Anadrol buy human grade and normally youll be fine; however, if you are more sensitive than average some acne may occur. The next question and perhaps the most common, who is Anadrol for in-terms of the performance enhancing world and the answer is simple; anyone looking for dramatic increases in strength and size will find this anabolic steroid to be for them. Granted, the side-effects are strong, the Back Pumps many attribute to Anadrol use can at times be unbearable but if you can handle it there isnt another anabolic steroid quite like it. Oxymetholone is one of the strongest androgenic steroid available.[citation needed] Similarly, it also poses the greatest risk of side effects of any steroid. Despite very low binding affinity with the androgen receptor, oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis.[citation needed] For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes. Many athletes also use <strong>oxymetholone</strong> as a method of protection for the joints under heavy loads. Due to the high water retention users experience from this drug, it similarly lubricates the joints and helps protect them from injury. Oxymetholone is widely considered by bodybuilders to have the strongest anabolic effect out of any <strong>oral steroid</strong> available.
<h2>Anadrol Cycles</h2>
While there are many cycles and stacks we can plan, quality Anadrol cycles are without question very hard to beat. Most commonly Anadrol cycles are run during off-season periods of growth as thesteroid is well-suited for rapidly building mass and increasing strength. Of course Anadrol cycles can be part of a cutting plan and very effectively so but as the vast majority supplement for off-season periods of use it will be this period we focus on here. As a powerful DHT based anabolic steroid Anadrol can rapidly increase size; it is not uncommon for increases in weight to reach 20-30lbs in mere weeks of use. Further, if that wasnt enough those who supplement with this steroid can expect to see their strength shoot through the roof; strength and size with full and well-rounded muscles, for many performance enhancers this is the end all be all. Of course before you plan any of your Anadrol cycles, although those are some amazing benefits that can be obtained youre going to need to know how to go about it. Contrary to popular culture belief you cannot simply supplement with anabolic steroids; you do not randomly pour a bottle of pills down your throat or arbitrarily jam a needle in your butt; there is planning, doses, length and what to stack.
<h3>The Basics:</h3>
Before you plan any Anadrol cycles there is one very important prerequisite that must be fulfilled; education. It is very important you familiarize yourself with the hormone; read and study various profiles and reviews and ensure you have a sound understanding of the hormones functions so as to eliminate any surprises later on down the road. Once the hormone is understood its actually time to start planning. In most all cases, most Anadrol cycles will run for 4-6 weeks of use at a dosing of 50mg per day; for most men there will never be a need to go over this amount. Luckily for you this steroid comes in 50mg tablets making supplementation very easy. Of course some will want more and doses as high as 100mg can be used but should only be used by very experienced and only when absolutely necessary. One should keep in mind the higher the dose goes the greater the risk of adverse side-effects will be; you may indeed get a little more out of 100mg per day but the odds of incurring adverse effects are not in your favor. Beyond 100mg is not advisable; not only is it very dangerous its actually pointless. Unlike many anabolic androgenic steroids Anadrol appears to hold to a sharp fall-off curve; simply put, a dose of say 150mg is not going to do much more than a dose of 100mg and will in-short be a waste of good Anadrol.
<h3>Sample Anadrol Cycles:</h3>
We have provided you four sample Anadrol cycles from which to choose; the first is for a fresh beginner, one is moderate, the third is somewhat advanced with the final cycle being for the far advanced anabolic steroid user. One of the first things you may have noticed is testosterone is included in each and every cycle and necessarily so. Like most all anabolic steroids Anadrol will greatly suppress your natural testosterone production and as you need testosterone and essentially so, it must be provided in exogenous form. In reality though the added testosterone is a benefit as this is the most important and beneficial anabolic steroid to begin with by far; in reality, testosterone is the foundation and Anadrol is the addition. Regardless of your level of experience one of these Anadrol cycles will more than likely meet your needs. It is however important to note, were not saying you cant plan your Anadrol cycles differently than what we have laid out here; weve simply provided you four sample Anadrol cycles that are highly efficient and effective but there are truly numerous options.

Semglee is a Lantus Insulin Biosimilar and it contains the main ingredient Insulin Glargine. Semglee is considered long-acting and must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted with any other solution because it might not work as intended. Needles need to be obtained separately for the pens and they come in sizes of 31G (5mm), 32G (4-6mm), and 34G (4mm).

</div>
&nbsp;
<h2 id=""uses"" class=""ddc-anchor-offset"">What is Semglee?</h2>
Semglee is a man-made form of a hormone (insulin) that is produced in the body. Insulin is a hormone that works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that starts to work several hours after injection and keeps working evenly for 24 hours.

Semglee is used to improve blood sugar control in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Semglee is for use in adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes and in children at least 6 years old with type 1 diabetes (not type 2).
<ul>
 	<li>Semglee is not for use to treat diabetic ketoacidosis.</li>
 	<li>It is not known if Semglee is safe and effective in children less than 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes.</li>
 	<li>It is not known if Semglee is safe and effective in children with type 2 diabetes.</li>
</ul>
For type 1 diabetes, Semglee is used together with a short-acting insulin given before meals.

Do not share your syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them.

&nbsp;
<h2 id=""side-effects"" class=""ddc-anchor-offset"">Semglee side effects</h2>
Get emergency medical help if you have <b>any signs of an allergic reaction to Semglee:</b> redness or swelling where an injection was given, itchy skin rash over the entire body, trouble breathing, fast heartbeats, feeling like you might pass out, or swelling in your tongue or throat.

<h3><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>
This medication description is not meant for treatment prescription without the intervention of a specialist

<strong>Common Uses</strong> Zolpidem is a sedative-hypnotic, or sleep medicine. It works by helping to increase certain natural chemicals in the brain that cause sleep.

<strong>How to Take</strong> Before start taking any new medicine please consult with a doctor. The recommended dosage for adults is 10 mg right before bedtime. Your doctor will prescribe a smaller dose if you are likely to be sensitive to the drug or have a liver problem. Never take more than 10 mg of Zolpidem per day.

<strong>Warning and Precautions</strong> Zolpidem may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Zolpidem with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it. Do not drink alcohol or use medicines that may cause drowsiness (eg, sleep aids, muscle relaxers) while you are using Zolpidem; it may add to their effects. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines may cause drowsiness. When you first start taking Zolpidem, it may have a ""carryover"" effect on you the next day. Use extreme care while doing anything that requires complete alertness (eg, driving a car). Zolpidem is usually used only for a short period of time. If your symptoms do not get better within 7 to 10 days or if they get worse, check with your doctor. Sleep medicines may cause a special type of memory loss or amnesia. To prevent memory problems, be sure to use Zolpidem only when you are able to get a full night's sleep (7 to 8 hours) before you need to be active again. Be sure to talk to your health care provider if you think you are having memory problems. Some patients taking Zolpidem have performed certain activities while they were not fully awake. These have included sleep-driving, making and eating food, making phone calls, and having sex. Patients often do not remember these events after they happen. Such an event may be more likely to occur if you use a high dose of Zolpidem. It may also be more likely if you drink alcohol or take other medicines that may cause drowsiness while you use Zolpidem. Tell your doctor right away if such an event happens to you.

<strong>Important </strong>If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Zolpidem while you are pregnant. Zolpidem may cause prolonged sleep in the fetus when used during the last weeks of pregnancy. Zolpidem is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Zolpidem, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.

<strong>Missed Dose</strong> If your doctor gave you strict instructions not to miss dose and if you missed one take the missed dose as soon as you remembered. If it is time for your next dose, skip it and continue taking you medicine regularly. Do not double the medicine. It can cause severe side effects.

<strong>Overdose</strong> Almost any medicine taking in excess doses without consultation with your doctor can cause an overdose. Symptoms of overdose may include: fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, severe drop in blood pressure.If you suspect an overdose contact your emergency room immediately.

<strong>Storage</strong> Zolpidem should be stored at room temperature in a container it comes in. Protect from heat, sun light and moisture. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep away from pets and children.

<strong>Possible Side Effects</strong> Any of the medicine can cause side effects. If the side effects occur seek medical attention or consult with your doctor for more information. Anyway such common side effects may bother you: allergy, daytime drowsiness, dizziness, drugged feeling, headache, indigestion, nausea. Seek medical attention if any of these side effects occur: chest pain, allergic reactions, difficulty swallowing or breathing, fainting, irregular or slow heartbeat, shortness of breath, unusual stomach pain.

<strong>More Information </strong>The information given above is a summary. Your doctor, pharmacies or health care provider can provide more information about Zolpidem. Do not share this medicine with others for whom it was not prescribed. Do not use this medicine for other health conditions. Do not store medication with end term of storage.","&nbsp;
